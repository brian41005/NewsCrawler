Curious alignments over Hammersmith and Fulham social housing plans,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/may/18/curious-alignments-over-hammersmith-and-fulham-social-housing-plans,uk-news,I remarked while ago on the unlikely alignment in the political battleground of Hammersmith and Fulham between the local radical Conservatives and the campaign to Defend Council Housing  DCH Both are warning council tenants on the borough estates that the Labour run borough residents  housing commission looking into moving their homes to the ownership of housing associations would not be good for them DCH opposes such stock transfers as form of privatisation that weakens tenants  rights and increases their rents  The Tories are citing DCH views approvingly  In March  Charlie Dewhirst  the party  ultimately unsuccessful  parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith produced leaflet for council tenants quoting the DCH critique and warning that under Labour plans council housing in the borough could cease to be The Labour administration is scornful of the Conservatives  activities  noting that before it took charge of the Town Hall following shock victory last May  the Tories had been eagerly selling off council stock on the open market and had put two entire estates at the disposal of property developer Capital and Counties  Capco  for very friendly price as part of the Earls Court Project  surely the worst major regeneration scheme in London Labour rationale for setting up the commission  led by formed Labour minister Keith Hill  is that the more of its homes that pass into housing association hands  the fewer there will be for any future Tory regime to flog off or arrange to have knocked down to make way for stacks of expensive private flats that only the likes of Capco directors can afford  No wonder Dewhirst and co want the housing to stay in council hands As for DCH  Labour is exasperated that the group campaigning against the commission is  however inadvertently  helping the Tories spread their mischief  But DCH is sticking to its line  adding that  thanks to the reforms of the last national government  housing associations are nowadays likely to introduce the more expensive  affordable rent  tenures for new homes and tenancies and claiming that the types of small scale  tenant controlled housing association the Hill commission is looking at setting up offer only hollow promises of security There a further dimension to all this  The tenants and residents associations  TRAs  of the two estates threatened by the Earls Court scheme have long been exploring taking ownership of the   homes they comprise under provisions the coalition brought into being under its localism banner and have set up company called West Kensington and Gibbs Green Community Homes to that end  The council  immersed in complex and very hush hush negotiations with Capco in an attempt to save the estates  is not keen on this initiative Meanwhile  the steering group of residents set up and funded by the F Tories and Capco effectively to by pass the opposition of the TRAs and create an illusion that estate residents were in favour of demolition programme that the bulk of them  in fact  opposed has produced newsletter criticising the TRAs and the council  praising Capco plans for rehousing tenants elsewhere in the regeneration area and containing criticisms of housing associations that match those in the Dewhirst leaflet almost word for word  What curious state of affairs Where all this will end is anyone guess  but it helpfully highlights the predicaments and complexities of protecting social housing of every kind in the current political climate a climate that has become still more hostile with the election of Conservative national government whose policy of extending the right to buy to housing associations will  if implemented  entail councils in London  and elsewhere  selling off their highest value homes in order to help finance it  What way to solve housing crisis

Fallon urged to act on whistleblower claims about Trident nuclear subs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/18/fallon-urged-act-whistleblowers-claims-trident-nuclear-subs,uk-news,The defence secretary  Michael Fallon  has been urged to investigate catalogue of alleged security failings around the Trident nuclear programme exposed by Royal Navy whistleblower Brendan Hara  the Scottish National party MP for Argyll and Bute  which includes the Faslane submarine base  said that the security lapses described by Able Seaman William McNeilly appeared to be  extremely worrying  and merited further investigation O Hara told the Guardian As an SNP MP implacably opposed to Trident but also as the local MP  am extremely worried by these allegations  even if only half of what the report claims is true  The issue of safety is absolutely paramount  especially when the base is so close to major centre of population  The newly elected MP added that he would write to Fallon to demand an investigation into the allegations  which he said  appear to confirm many concerns that have already been reported including those raised by the SNP Westminster leader  Angus Robertson  in number of written questions in the Commons The MP spoke as second Royal Navy whistleblower came forward to warn of security lapses in the service  saying that he found the allegations made by McNeilly to be persuasive The police and the navy launched hunt for McNeilly  when he went absent without leave from the Faslane naval base last week after publishing his report  The Nuclear Secrets  online In the  page dossier  McNeilly claimed that it was more difficult to get into some nightclubs than to gain access to Britain nuclear programme facility  Referring to chronic shortage of personnel  he suggested that it was  matter of time before we re infiltrated by psychopath or terrorist  McNeilly said he was preparing to hand himself in to police on Monday afternoon after being on the run since last week  In Facebook statement posted on Monday morning he told supporters There nothing can do from prison  whatever happens now is up to you and the government  On Monday former Royal Navy communications and information technology specialist said that McNeilly actions inspired him to speak out for the first time about the security lapses he saw while serving Euan Bryson  told the Guardian that McNeilly concerns about security breaches  rang true from my experience He described how shipmate routinely used blue bank card to get past security into his base after losing his Royal Navy identity card on night out Bryson  who served on HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious and was based at Faslane before leaving the service in   said there were  manning issues  across the board meaning that relatively junior employees were often tasked to do jobs they did not have the security training or clearance to carry out  made my thoughts clear when served  including when handed in my resignation notice  The chain of command system has failed  If McNeilly felt ignored what other option did he have  You join to serve the country but if you feel your job is not serving it then you have an option to speak out  But  as the Ministry of Defence launched its own investigation into the allegations  senior members of the Royal Navy community sought to cast doubt on McNeilly claims  Peter Roberts  former Royal Navy warfare officer who retired last year after  years  service  said the report contained number of basic factual errors  from McNeilly use of jargon to the safe diving level for submarines  Most of his claims about on board the submarines are factually incorrect and there a degree of sensationalism  For that reason can place too much weight on it he said Roberts  who is now senior researcher at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank  said he did not think the allegations warranted high level Ministry of Defence investigation but that local inquiry into security at Faslane may be necessary McNeilly  newly qualified engineer from Newtonabbey near Belfast  now faces substantial jail term if he is prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act  An online petition against his prosecution has amassed more than   signatories since it was launched on Sunday Dee McLoughlin  who grew up with McNeilly in Newtonabbey  insisted that his friend was  not the type to make things up McLoughlin told the Guardian He a pretty leval headed person and know how much he loved his job in the navy  honestly couldn see him throwing it away unless it was for good reason  McNeilly  who said he was on patrol with HMS Victorious from January to April  accused navy bosses of covering up collision between HMS Vanguard and French submarine in the Atlantic Ocean in February  At the time  MoD officials played down the incident and said the Vanguard had sustained only  scrapes But McNeilly said in his report that navy chief who was on board at the time told him afterwards We thought  this is it we re all going to die  The more senior submariner allegedly told McNeilly that the French vessel  took massive chunk out of the front of HMS Vanguard  and grazed the side of the boat  Bottles of high pressured air came loose in the collision  he claimed  and the British submarine had to return slowly to Faslane to prevent them from exploding McNeilly went on to describe how HMS Vanguard missile compartment doubled up as gym  leading to potentially disastrous mishaps when seamen dropped weights near the boat missile firing system He said he raised these and other concerns through the chain of command on multiple occasions  but that  not once did someone even attempt to make change  MoD officials sought to downplay the allegations on Monday  Royal Navy spokeswoman said the service disagreed with McNeilly assessment and described the report as containing  number of subjective and unsubstantiated personal views  But in his Facebook statement  McNeilly countered Responding by downplaying report because there lack of seniority  acting like your security system is impenetrable and your aged system is still in excellent condition for sailing  is not an adequate response  He explained that he had moved between countries and changed location every day since going on the run  but that he now  lacks the resources to remain undercover

admitted for  mild  chest infection and would have expected to  sail through this storm But she was pronounced dead eight hours after admission after being treated with saline ampoule contaminated with insulin Weaver was admitted with chest infection and  after being given saline drip appeared to be in agony  eyes rolling back in his head He died  days later Chua was also found guilty of  counts of attempted grievous bodily harm  one count of grievous bodily harm  seven attempts of administering poison and one count of administering poison  He will be sentenced on Tuesday He was cleared of murdering Arnold Lancaster  who was suffering from cancer  but convicted of attempting to cause him grievous bodily harm with intent by poisoning  He was also acquitted of one count of manslaughter and one count of attempting to administer poison Zubia Aslam  who survived her saline drip being contaminated  said Life has not been the same and never will be  This has turned my life upside down  but also that of my family  and still have questions about how this was allowed to happen in the first place  What measures have been taken to date and will be taken going forward to ensure that this never happens again  Prosecutors told the jury Chua had taken out his personal frustrations on patients  for reasons truly known only to himself  but drew attention to self penned letter found at Chua home after his arrest Described as  the bitter nurse confession  by Chua  he said he was  an angel turned into an evil person  and  there a devil in me He also wrote of having things he would  take to the grave  In his closing speech  prosecutor Peter Wright QC said What may lead an otherwise caring  unassuming and conscientious nurse to act as we say he did is impossible to fathom  Greater Manchester police has described the investigation that led to Chua arrest and conviction as one of the the biggest and most complex it has ever confronted Some   statements were obtained and   items were exhibited  while the prosecution file exceeds    pages Detectives also flew to Chua native Philippines  where they were able to establish that he left one hospital after being caught stealing  They also visited the now defunct Galang training college  where he claimed to have obtained his medical qualifications  As result of investigations conducted  serious doubt has been cast relating to the authenticity of them DS Simon Barraclough  who led the inquiry  said Hidden in plain sight and using unsuspecting colleagues to carry out his sinister plan  Victorino Chua deliberately poisoned and murdered those who were under his care and those who were at their most vulnerable and most in need of help  He would then watch the fruits of his labour unfold  as absolute chaos ensued across the wards as colleagues fought to save patients whilst attempting to comprehend what was happening  Sir Peter Fahy  chief constable of Greater Manchester police  GMP said the force nearly shut down Stepping Hill hospital at the start of the investigation  to protect patients He said At one point we were pretty close to it but can only tell you when you get into that and start looking at how the NHS operates  you realise that that would have been huge challenge  What we were faced with is if we had to close the hospital  or even part of the hospital and in particular if we had to move very frail patients to another site  that in itself could have led to deaths and could have caused enormous risks  Fahy apologised to nurse Rebecca Leighton  who was initially arrested on suspicion of Chua crimes and spent six weeks in custody He said We are very sorry that Rebecca Leighton ended up spending some time in prison  It showed to some degree the amount of pressure everyone was under  not just the police  the hospital  Crown Prosecution Service  to try and make progress in the case  and we are sorry this happened  Ann Barnes  the chief executive of Stockport NHS foundation trust  which runs Stepping Hill hospital  said Our storage of saline and management of prescription charts at the time of the incident was typical of those in other hospitals across the country  Whilst no hospital systems and processes can offer complete guarantee against the actions of determined criminal  additional measures are now in place which go beyond standard practice  She added Whilst Victorino Chua crimes are truly dreadful  we are sure patients will understand that they have no bearing at all upon our care

Trident submarine whistleblower to turn himself in to police,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/18/trident-submarine-whistleblower-william-mcneilly-to-turn-himself-in,uk-news,A Royal Navy submariner who exposed catalogue of alleged security failings around the Trident nuclear programme is facing jail after promising to hand himself in to police on Monday Able Seaman William McNeilly  went on the run after claiming that Britain nuclear deterrent was  disaster waiting to happen  in report detailing  alleged safety and security breaches He wrote that security lapses at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde  where he is based  meant it was only  matter of time before we re infiltrated by psychopath or terrorist  Brendan Hara  the new SNP MP for Argyll and Bute  which includes the Faslane base  said that he would be writing to the defence secretary Michael Fallon to call for an immediate inquiry in McNeilly claims The  page report  which was published online  triggered an immediate investigation by the Ministry of Defence as police and Royal Navy chiefs tried to track down the submariner McNeilly  who is understood to have been overseas when the dossier was published  was due to return to the UK on Monday afternoon and hand himself in to the police In statement published on his Facebook page  the  year old said he had moved between countries and changed location every day since going on the run  but that he now  lacks the resources to remain undercover  He wrote I ve tried my best over the past year  and ve finally achieved what set out to do  set out to gather as much information as possible  as fast as possible  inform you and the government before getting caught  then hand myself into the police  There nothing can do from prison  whatever happens now is up to you and the government  McNeilly now faces substantial jail term if he is prosecuted under the Officials Secrets Act   In   Royal Navy petty officer Edward Devenney was jailed for eight years for offering classified nuclear submarine information to MI  agents posing as Russian spies An online petition against his prosecution has amassed more than   signatories since it was launched on Sunday On Facebook  McNeilly gave the impression of an ordinary  year old who enjoyed socialising with friends and watching popular TV series including Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad  His brother  Aaron  wrote on the social network that no one had heard from McNeilly since last Thursday when he left home to go to the airport In the  report  titled The Secret Nuclear Threat  and published online alongside picture of his UK passport and Royal Navy identity card  McNeilly said he wanted  to break down the false images of perfect system that most people envisage exists  He described Trident as  broken system  and said the focus should be on  peacefully removing the threat  and that Britain was heading for  catastrophe  if security was not improved on the nuclear submarines McNeilly  newly qualified engineer who said he was on patrol with HMS Victorious from January to April  described bags going unchecked and said it was  harder getting into most nightclubs  than into control rooms  with broken pin code systems and guards failing to check passes All it takes is someone to bring bomb on board to commit the worst terrorist attack the UK and the world has ever seen he wrote McNeilly accused navy bosses of covering up collision between HMS Vanguard and French submarine in the Atlantic Ocean in February  At the time  Ministry of Defence officials played down the incident and said the Vanguard had sustained only  scrapes But McNeilly said navy chief who was on board at the time told him afterwards We thought  this is it we re all going to die  The more senior submariner allegedly told McNeilly that the French vessel  took massive chunk out of the front of HMS Vanguard  and grazed the side of the boat  Bottles of high pressured air came loose in the collision  he claimed  and the British submarine had to return slowly to Faslane to prevent them from exploding McNeilly also raised concerns about number of his fellow seamen  including one whose hobbies he claimed were killing small animals and watching extreme pornography  Another submariner  whom he named only as  Pole had threatened to kill two fellow navy personnel and was routinely aggressive  McNeilly claimed He described how HMS Vanguard missile compartment doubled up as gym  leading to potentially disastrous mishaps when seamen dropped weights near the boat missile firing system McNeilly said he raised these and other concerns through the chain of command on multiple occasions  but that  not once did someone even attempt to make change  The whistleblower also revealed that there had allegedly been fire in the missile compartment when the vessel was in harbour  He claimed the blaze was sparked by overheated cables setting light to stacks of toilet roll The chief said if it had been at sea there would ve been about  dead bodies on three deck because of the amount of people struggling to find an emergency breathing system he claimed The McNeilly revelations prompted another former Royal Navy sailor to speak out about security lapses in the service  Euan Bryson  a communications specialist who served on the HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious  said McNeilly allegations  rang true  Bryson  who was also based at Faslane for two years before he left the service in   said shipmate routinely used blue bank card to get past security into base after losing his Royal Navy identity card on night out  My biggest concern is the security element  In my entire time never once had bag searched he said I made my thoughts clear when served and when handed in my resignation  The chain of command system has failed  Bryson said there was  manning issues  across the board meaning that relatively junior employees were often tasked to do jobs they did not have the security training or clearance to carry out Ministry of Defence officials have launched an investigation into his claims but also sought to downplay their significance  Royal Navy spokeswoman said the service disagreed with McNeilly assessment and described the report as containing  number of subjective and unsubstantiated personal views  But McNeilly stood by his leaks  Writing on Facebook  the  year old said he had anticipated that Royal Navy chiefs would go on the offensive rather than tackling the safety and security issues he raised  Security at the site must  be  heightened immediately whether you make the transition to nuclear disarmament or not  Responding by downplaying report because there lack of seniority  acting like your security system is impenetrable and your aged system is still in excellent condition for sailing  is not an adequate response he wrote He also gave an insight into his time on the run  claiming to have used counter surveillance techniques and false aliases to avoid detection  He added I have had few suspicious run ins along the way such as  someone spending hours trying to into my room without knocking  lock the door with the key in it best security ever someone trying to get me down an alley and someone coming over and touching my laptop in public  to see what was doing  A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said earlier on Monday that the Royal Navy was working with the police to track down McNeilly as it was concerned about his  whereabouts and wellbeing  The spokeswoman said it was right for the allegations to be investigated but that the publishing of the report did not pose security risk  She added The Royal Navy takes security and nuclear safety extremely seriously and we are fully investigating both the issue of the unauthorised release of this document and its contents The naval service operates its submarine fleet under the most stringent safety regime and submarines do not go to sea unless they are completely safe to do so  
Navy whistleblower on run after exposing alleged Trident safety failings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/18/navy-whistleblower-on-run-alleged-trident-safety-failings,uk-news,A Royal Navy submariner who blew the whistle on catalogue of alleged security failings around the Trident nuclear programme has said he will hand himself in to police Able Seaman William McNeilly  a newly qualified engineer  claimed that Britain nuclear deterrent was  disaster waiting to happen  in report detailing  alleged safety and security breaches  including collision between HMS Vanguard and French submarine during which senior officer thought We re all going to die  McNeilly wrote that chronic shortage of personnel meant that it was  matter of time before we re infiltrated by psychopath or terrorist  with this amount of people getting pushed through  The police and the navy launched hunt for McNeilly after he failed to report back for work last week at the Faslane submarine base on the Clyde  But on Monday morning he said he would hand himself over to the authorities despite facing possible prosecution under the Official Secrets Act  Speaking to the BBC  McNeilly said I not hiding from arrest  will be back in the UK in the next few days and will hand myself in to the police Prison such nice reward for sacrificing everything to warn the public and government  Unfortunately that the world we live in  know it a lot to sacrifice and it is hard road to walk down  but other people need to start coming forward  In the  page report  titled The Secret Nuclear Threat and published online alongside picture of his UK passport and Royal Navy identity card  McNeilly said he wanted  to break down the false images of perfect system that most people envisage

most painful  of his life  and that he had  sacrificed everything  to make the claims He wrote that he was hopeful of receiving pardon from David Cameron when he handed himself in to the police I also believe it in the prime minister best interests to release me  Prosecuting someone for alerting the people and the government to major threat isn a good image for any government he added Angus Robertson  the Scottish National party leader in Westminster  described the claims as extremely concerning and said the allegations add weight to calls to scrap Trident altogether He said It reads as nightmare catalogue of serious safety breaches aboard and alongside these nuclear armed submarines   Shortages of all types of crew on these submarines has been well documented and the description of personnel in extremely stressful situations must be alarming given the huge responsibility some of these sailors are given  Failure to follow standard safety procedures is unacceptable in any workplace but on Vanguard submarine on patrol it could result in extreme tragedy not just for those on board but indeed for the entire planet  A Royal Navy spokeswoman said on Monday that the service disagreed with McNeilly assessment  describing the report as containing  number of subjective and unsubstantiated personal views  The spokeswoman said it was right for the allegations to be

Geologists use jelly  lasers and water to unravel mystery of volcanic eruption,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/geologists-use-jelly-lasers-and-water-to-unravel-mystery-of-volcanic-eruption,world,Scientists have discovered previously unrecognised potential trigger for volcanic eruptions during an experiment involving jelly  lasers and coloured water Sandy Cruden  geologist at Monash University in Melbourne  said the scientists came to the finding by accident during study of how magma moves through layers of rock in the earth crust Cruden said working out why magma ascends along vertical fractures  called dykes  before turning along horizontal ones called sills  is  classic problem in geology  Researchers from Monash have teamed up with colleagues from Newcastle and Liverpool universities in the UK to study the plumbing systems of volcanoes with scaled down model version in laboratory They filled tank with two layers of pig skin gelatine of differing strengths as an analogue of the earth crust and injected it with coloured water to mimic ascending magma  When the simulated dyke hit the upper layer of gelatine it turned into sill  travelling between the two gelatine layers The gelatine was also injected with tiny fluorescent particles  When hit by moving laser the particles lit up and could be captured using high speed camera In the experiment  which took place at Monash  the scientists observed collapse of the dyke  which would indicate significant drop in pressure Cruden said scientists knew volcanic eruptions were triggered when the side of volcano collapses  reducing the pressure in magma chamber  But this was the first time that process has been connected to the collapse of dyke during the formation of sill Magma was full of dissolved gases like champagne or coke Cruden said  He likened the process to removing cap from shaken bottle of fizzy drink  with the drop in pressure causing bubbles to form and erupt in fountain of foam While the use of water  rather than gas filled magma  meant their experiment did not lead to volcano like explosion  Cruden and the other scientists calculated its magnitude of pressure and found equated conditions in natural setting would be enough to produce an eruption Cruden said the discovery had big implications for predicting when volcanoes would erupt  The  eruptions of Eyjafjallajo kull in Iceland was preceded by the formation of dykes and sills  for example Volcanoes were inherently dangerous places to work and with much of their activity taking place thousands of metres underground there was little understanding of how they operated  Cruden said  Such challenges put added importance on using models to observe the physics of magma migration The work was important to improve the accuracy of volcanic eruption predictions  which Cruden said was  not particularly great  in the scientific community  though still better than their ability to predict earthquakes  It a bit like reading tea leaves  You ve got all these signals coming out of the ground  But what we really need is better understanding of the physical processes that make those signals  Cruden said their experiment contributed to better understanding of the physics behind an eruption and puts volcanologists  in better position to read those signals  so that we can predict when an eruption is going to occur

Nauru sex assault allegations not reported to workplace watchdog,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/nauru-sex-assault-allegations-not-reported-to-workplace-watchdog,world,Australia immigration department did not notify the federal workplace watchdog of serious allegations of sexual assault at the Nauru detention centre in what appears to be contravention of its own reporting guidelines A Senate inquiry into serious allegations of assault and abuse at the Nauru centre is set to get under way on Tuesday with public hearings Submissions to the inquiry have revealed serious concerns about the wellbeing of asylum seekers on the island  with claims that pregnant women have been forced to create makeshift toilets and are afraid of going to the bathroom at night because of fears for their safety The immigration department guidelines on what matters the workplace authority Comcare must be notified of include sexual assaults and serious assaults in detention centres But in Comcare incident logs obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws  no incidents of sexual assault have been reported in the past  months  despite series of reports that were made internally to the immigration department The Greens senator Sarah Hanson Young said The department must come clean over why serious incidents like sexual assault have not been reported to Comcare as required  The more we learn about the abuse inside the Nauru camp the more we discover just how far the government has gone to cover up what been going on and what the minister knew and chose to ignore  The institutionalised secrecy and cover up has allowed culture of abuse to fester  and worse it has left those children and young women who are victims of assault locked up unable to escape their abusers  In one such incident in November   report provided to the immigration department by detention contractor Transfield outlined serious allegations that cleaner had sexually assaulted young asylum seeker  Transfield said at the time the report was only an allegation  but the report contained an admission from the cleaner that his hand had come into contact with the child genitals The incident is not listed in the Comcare files  The logs  which cover mainland and offshore centres  reveal the immigration department only reported handful of incidents to Comcare  including suitcase falling on to worker  an electric shock from phone  inhaling powder from fire extinguisher and worker being sprayed with raw sewage Some of these events did spark inspection reports by Comcare at the detention centre  but all these inspections identified no issues that required enforcement activity from the agency Comcare also undertook one proactive inspection in October   records of which were obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws  During the visit the Comcare officer said they were  satisfied that IDBP are ensuring  as far as reasonably practical  the health and safety of workers at NRPC  They suggested some improvements surrounding bathroom facilities  mould treatment  safety issues at staff accommodation and providing information to staff about the  health impacts  if any  as result of being geographically located near phosphate mining activity  A spokesman for Comcare said that in  one allegation of sexual assault was referred in late   but confirmed they were not notified of the November  incident  The incident you have outlined was not referred to Comcare and was not included in your FOI response on that basis he said  An alleged sexual assault at the Nauru detention centre was referred to Comcare by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection in late   but it was not notifiable incident under the Work Health and Safety Act   Over the past  months there have been repeated concerns raised about serious sexual assaults at the detention centre  review conducted by former integrity commissioner Philip Moss substantiated some of these sexual assault allegations The immigration department  Transfield Services  Wilson Security and Save the Children are set to appear before the Senate inquiry on Tuesday 
Woman seized in anti Isis raid poses policy problems for US,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/woman-seized-anti-isis-raid-poses-policy-problems-us,world,The US has still not revealed its intentions for its first high profile Islamic State detainee  two days after the Umm Sayyaf was taken captive in Syria The woman  whom the US described as the wife of Isis member Abu Sayyaf  was seized during special operations raid on Saturday and according to the White House  she is being held in US military custody in Iraq But her capture raises host of thorny policy questions for the Obama administration  which has taken few terrorist detainees and prosecuted those it has taken in US federal courts  Under Obama  US forces had not previously made any battlefield detentions outside Afghanistan  and the US military has closed its detention facilities there and in Iraq Asked what will become of Umm Sayyaf  Colonel Steve Warren  the interim top Pentagon spokesman  said  we have no announcements to make  Human rights advocates  recalling the legacy of legal and physical abuse in US wartime detention facilities  are starting to press the Obama administration to charge Umm Sayyaf with crime in federal court or release her  If the US has sufficient evidence that Umm Sayyaf has violated US law  it should charge her and bring her before judge promptly  and provide her with access to an attorney and medical treatment  If there isn sufficient evidence to charge her  she should be released said Andrea Prasow of Human Rights Watch  Given the widespread use of torture in Iraqi prisons  the US should not transfer her to Iraqi custody  doing so would violate the Convention Against Torture  Karen Greenberg  director of the national security program at Fordham University Law School  said she expected that any resolution of Umm Sayyaf detention would follow her interrogation by US officials  The Obama administration would not confirm on Monday if or whether Umm Sayyaf has or will be interrogated by its high value detainee interrogation group  but the Daily Beast reported the group is questioning her  As long as the United States is going to be the country that is trying terrorists  whether or not they have specific threats against the United States  then it makes sense to bring her into US courts  bring the evidence before judge  and to charge her Greenberg said  noting that pre charge interrogations for terror suspects  hasn disrupted the ability to prosecute them  On Saturday  Warren told the Guardian the administration would not transfer Umm Sayyaf to the detention facility at Guanta namo Bay  CNN reported that Umm Sayyaf is an Iraqi national  but Human Rights Watch has documented extensive abuse  particularly against women  in Iraqi interior and defense ministry jails  making transfer to Iraqi custody problem for US compliance with international obligations It is unclear if prosecuting the Isis captive is priority for the administration  Nor is it obvious if Umm Sayyaf has committed crime under US federal law  White House statement on Saturday confidently called her  member  of Isis who had played an unspecified  important role  in Isis terrorism  but could only speculate that she was  complicit in the enslavement  of young woman freed in the US raid Mary Ellen Connell  professor of international law at the University of Notre Dame  said that under international law  the US is technically required to hand Umm Sayyaf over to the government of the Syrian dictator  Bashar al Assad We don want to do that  obviously she said  The next best thing O Connell said  would be to rely on the International Committee of the Red Cross for  removing her to place of detention  in place where she will be treated according to international humanitarian law  and would ask the International Committee of the Red Cross to make that transfer perhaps to detention center in Jordan In announcing the raid and capture on Saturday  White House and Pentagon statements said US troops entered eastern Syria for  capture  mission  But Pentagon and White House representatives have yet to explain how they launched capture mission without plan for what to do with the captive Lt  Col  Myles  Caggins III  the Defense Department spokesman for detainee policy  said We are working to determine an ultimate disposition for the detainee that best supports the national security of the United States and of our allies and partners  consistent with domestic and international law  
Citizen Pe ladeau  flamboyant tycoon ready to revitalize Quebec separatists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/citizen-peladeau-flamboyant-tycoon-ready-to-revitalize-quebecs-separatists,world,Ice hockey is religion in Quebec  but since the departure of the NHL Nordiques to Colorado in   residents of the provincial capital  Quebec City  have had no icons to worship So when Pierre Karl Pe ladeau the CEO of Quebecor  Canada second biggest media group announced in  that he would invest   to lease new arena and bring hockey club back to the city  he was hailed as prophet Now campaigners for Quebec independence hope that the media magnate can work miracles for their cause after Pe ladeau election as the new leader of the separatist Parti Que be cois  PQ  Thousands of party delegates joined in chants of  PKP  even before victory was confirmed on Friday evening in Quebec City  home of the provincial parliament Visibly pleased with his   share of the vote  Pe ladeau hugged his wife  the television producer Julie Snyder with whom he forms the ultimate power couple in the province of million people  You have given me clear and strong mandate  to make Quebec country said the  year old in bilingual speech Campaigners for independence have been starstruck ever since PKP joined the ranks of the Parti Que be cois mere  months ago  when he launched successful bid for election to the provincial parliament  vote which the Parti Libe ral won by landslide  Pe ladeau public embrace of independence had galvanizing effect on the separatist cause  Separatists and federalists alike agree that PKP dubbed  Citizen Pe ladeau  and often compared to the Italian media magnate turned politician Silvio Berlusconi brought star quality to the PQ  Is this the man who will break up Canada asked the national public affairs magazine Maclean In  Pe ladeau took the reins of Quebecor  the media empire built by his late father  self made man Pierre Pe ladeau  Ce line Dion and former Canadian PM Brian Mulroney are both godparents to two of his children Pe ladeau is also known for his explosive temper  Tales about his tantrums have become legendary in and out of the office  He has clashed repeatedly with unions imposing  lockouts during strikes at Quebecor companies and he has attempted to have labour laws weakened in the province But because support from the business elite has historically eluded the PQ  senior members of the left leaning party appear to have turned blind eye to Pe ladeau confrontational management style They may yet regret that decision  analysts say  PKP media holdings are now at the centre of an intense debate Quebecor is the largest press and telecommunications enterprise in the province with an empire which includes the most widely read newspaper  Journal de Montre al has   million readers  and television network  TVA  that draws the lion share of French language viewership with   Pe ladeau resigned as the CEO of Quebecor in   but the politician still owns   of voting shares worth at least    He has agreed to put them in blind trust under one condition  that they would not be sold If he has say on that matter  then it not blind trust says legal columnist Yves Boisvert of La Presse  Montreal broadsheet He has to find solution  and quickly  A longtime employee in TVA newsroom confirms that Pe ladeau still has an invisible but pervasive influence on the network There is an insidious pressure to feature other Quebecor holdings in our editorial content  Executives are in difficult position because he might return as their boss if the PQ loses the next election in    says the employee  who did not want to be named While Pe ladeau rightly insists that he is not breaking any law by owning   of the local media  his exceptional case will come under the scrutiny of parliamentary committee that will review ethics rules next week His influence on the local press  however  does not bother supporters of independence  referred to in Canada as sovereigntists If his media outlets support independence while the other   are federalists  think that fair said Andre  Paul Desbiens  bus driver and PQ supporter But there is growing sense of urgency amongst ageing nationalists that their dream is slipping out of reach  According to    survey  only   of adults aged   years old would choose independence  By contrast  of Scottish people aged  to  years old voted  Yes  in the September  referendum  Voting intentions are similar in Catalonia  where   of the electorate aged between  and  years old would vote for independence from Spain The PQ  which has been campaigning for independence since   has been traumatised by two  no  votes in the past in  and    and since   it has only held power in the province for  months  In   the party had   members  that figure is now around    Nationalists feel that Pe ladeau forceful personality and achievements can make their goal more tangible  according to poll analyst Youri Rivest PKP new leadership is the party last chance to revive its raison e tre predicts the vice president of the Crop firm But sovereigntists may hope that Pe ladeau moves faster on independence than he did on Quebec City hockey team  he has not delivered on his promise to resurrect the Nordiques  and Quebecor now in charge of the project has remained quiet

Alexis Tsipras claims Greece is close to securing deal with Brussels and the IMF,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/alexis-tsipras-claims-greece-close-deal-brussels-imf,world,The Greek prime minister  Alexis Tsipras  has sought to prevent full blown run on the debt stricken country banks by promising that he is close to reaching deal with creditors Speaking to group of business leaders  he said the government is ready to compromise with Brussels and the International Monetary Fund as long as deal will stabilise the situation and allow the country to raise money on the financial markets again Tsipras told the Federation of Hellenic Enterprises that Greece was  in the final straight for an agreement  with creditors  adding that deal would come  very soon  In late night interview on Greek television Yanis Varoufakis  the country finance minister said he expected deal with creditors next week  which would save the cash strapped country from fast approaching bankruptcy I think we are very close Varoufakis said Let say about week  The comments by Tsipras and Varoufakis came after Greek government spokesman denied suggestions Athens was considering Cyprus style raid on savers  bank accounts There would be blood in the streets Greeks are not like CypriotsBank employees have been talking of marked increase in withdrawals by depositors in recent weeks  Bank of Greece official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said People are taking more or less everything they have got out of their accounts for fear that the government will be dipping into them next  Many see it as the logical next step and after today statement we expect the outflows to increase  Around  bn   bn  is thought to have been withdrawn from Greek bank accounts since last December  Economists  politicians  bankers and officials are convinced that Cyprus style bail in  if executed  would be the straw that broke the camel back  We would see the revolt that this crisis has not yet produced  There would be blood in the streets  The Greeks are not like the Cypriots added the Bank of Greece official Investors also dumped Greek bonds as the country precarious finances and reluctance to carry out reforms suggested it would struggle to make key debt payment due next month Analysts remained divided over the prospects for country that has almost exhausted its ability to repay debts while maintaining welfare payments and salaries to public sector workers While some echoed the comments of Pierre Moscovici  the head of the EU monetary affairs  that deal was possible  others predicted that Greek default and exit from the euro was closer than ever RBS strategist Alberto Gallow said With missed payment  and potentially even debt restructuring  Greece could still stay in the eurozone subject to deeper adjustment programme  But Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire warned Greece is running on fumes and the risk of non payment of some form is riding high   These are desperate times and desperate stakes  That coin on the string trick that they played last time in terms of paying back the IMF cannot be repeated  Last week Greece scraped together the funds to repay       debt owed to the IMF but only after emptying an IMF holding account In further twist on Monday  the European commission was forced to deny Greek newspaper report that its president  Jean Claude Juncker  had tabled separate compromise proposal to Greece  sidelining the eurogroup of finance ministers Juncker was understood to have proposed easing public sector spending limits to allow Athens more leeway to use tax receipts to repay debts and maintain pensions and public sector wage rates This move was said to have infuriated Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem  who heads the eurogroup  which is the body given the task of negotiating compromise deal with Greece In recent days Tsipras has exploited divisions among creditors in an effort to extract deal that reduces the scope of reforms to pensions and public sector employment  which were both due to be overhauled under previous proposals As measure of the discord inside the troika of lenders  which includes the European Central Bank  IMF demands for debt repayments are known to have frustrated eurozone finance ministers who are keen to take more lenient stance with Athens following months of brinkmanship In leaked internal memo the IMF said Greece had little chance of making payment due on June and said it would not be pushed into  quick and dirty  review to disburse further bailout funds to Athens A Greek government spokesman responded that Athens aims to make all payments  He also said the country would not pursue Cyprus style strategy as part of third debt package with Brussels Gabriel Sakellaridis said the government would continue to hold on to its  red lines such as refusing further cuts to pensions and wages  He said We are not putting red lines because we have fetish about these red lines  We think they are necessary elements of deal so that we don once again have the problems of the past  But Germany central bank continued to insist Athens must honour previous reform pledges A sustainable solution is not possible without substantial reform in Greece the Bundesbank said Fears of disorderly Greek exit from the eurozone sparked flight of investors and sent the yield on two year Greek government bonds up   basis points to   the biggest one day rise for more than month  Yields  which are measure of the interest rate demanded by lenders  also rose sharply on  year Greek government bonds  up  basis points to    Worries around Greece finances also weighed on other low rated bonds  Portuguese  year yields rose  basis points to    Spanish and Italian yields were up   basis points at   and    respectively Yields on German bonds were broadly unchanged  steadying after three weeks of sharp swings  Athens  main stock index closed up  at   
Greece and the need to make sacrifices,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/greece-need-make-sacrifices,world,The choices before Greece are stark  either to accept the demands of the Eurogroup and its allies  or implement its government radical programmes and stick to them  If there is any real prospect of real change  the people must be willing to fight for it  It won happen by itself So which is it to be  rule by unelected European technocrats and the IMF  or rule by the people Despite its economic woes  the government still enjoys considerable popular support  both in its programmes and its efforts to negotiate an economic settlement  It is trying to negotiate loosening of the noose around the country neck  But to really be free  it would need to cut the rope entirely  Radical  Yes  Painful  Definitely  Dangerous  Certainly  but it is the only way of achieving level of autonomy that would allow people to choose its government and the way in which it is governed  So which is it to be  rule by unelected European technocrats and the IMF  or rule by the people  Most people are not willing to make sacrifices but the alternative is perpetual slavery  George HadjipaterasLondon  Larry Elliott   May  says Germany should not underestimate how strongly resentment burns in Greece about how the country suffered when it was occupied during the second world war Indeed  After all  Germany experienced similar emotions after the first world war  As Keynes  who in  in The Economic Consequences of the Peace had indicted the Allies for their treatment of Germany  wrote two years later in his Revision of the Treaty It has not been understood in England and America how deep wound has been inflicted on Germany self respect by compelling her not merely to perform acts but to subscribe to beliefs which she did not in fact accept He went on to laud  the victory for good sense  when the Allies in   did not call on Germany to do immediately   anything incapable of performance  but  instead wiped out the impossible liability under which she lay of paying forthwith balance of     gold  due under the treaty on May   If only the troika headed by Germany displayed the magnanimity and good sense towards Greece today Benedict Birnberg  London
Rout of Ramadi reawakens Iraq to  brutal reality ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/shia-militias-ramadi-isis-anbar-iraq,world,When Ramadi was last overrun by jihadis nine years ago  the rest of Iraq slid rapidly into chaos  Now Iraqis are trying to come to terms with the fall of the city for second time  with some predicting that this loss may prove even more catastrophic Islamic State took full control of Ramadi on Sunday night after Iraqi federal troops and police officers withdrew from the last government compounds and bases they had held since the militants stormed towards them on Friday Outgunned though far from outmanned  up to   soldiers and officers were seen streaming from the city to nearby highway  in scenes reminiscent of the fall of Mosul year ago  This was Isis biggest triumph since then a victory that belied claims that it was withering in the face of relentless air strikes and that Iraq military had learned how to hold its ground The rout left government officials reeling  By early Monday  ministers and paramilitary leaders were mobilising Shia militias to travel from Baghdad to take on the estimated   Isis fighters now in control of the city  Such was the speed of events that the prospect of Shia fighters being sent to the predominantly Sunni Anbar province met with little hostility from Ramadi residents  who until this week had disavowed the role that militias had played in the fighting elsewhere in the country  The ones to be blamed for this are the government and the local authorities in Ramadi said Saleh Eraqi  police colonel who fled on Sunday after his brother was killed in the fighting The army don have the fighting spirit  They were there waiting for Isis to attack  They are poorly equipped comparing to Isis  We are fighting with guns and pistols while Isis have Humvees and IEDs and suicide bombers  There are many Sunnis inside the city who want to fight Isis but they don have the weapons  Our only hope is that we can get real support from the Americans  Eraqi said the Shia militias  known as Hashd al Shaabi  or the popular mobilisation units  faced an enormous challenge in winning back the city as Isis members stream towards it from elsewhere in Anbar province  The Hashd al Shaabi can do it he said They will suffer huge losses  saw Isis fighting  they were more than  most of them Iraqis with some foreigners  and they had support from sleeper cells inside the city  We fought them from  in the morning till  pm but we almost ran out of weapons and had to withdraw  Ramadi  which sits on both the Euphrates river and highway connecting Baghdad to the Jordanian and Syrian borders  has been the centre of gravity in Anbar province throughout the past  years of war and insurrection  It was hub for foreign fighters crossing from Syria from   and  over the past year  it has been contested by government forces and militants who have crept towards the city from Iraq western deserts Sunni tribal leaders were instrumental in protecting the city  just as they were in  during crucial phase of the US occupation in which Ramadi tribes rose up against the Islamic State of Iraq  an earlier incarnation of Isis  ousting the group from their midst with the support of US ground forces But since then  some Sunni communities in Ramadi and Fallujah have been central to claims that Iraq post US governments have pursued sectarian policies that benefit the majority Shias Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al Bahari  tribal leader whose members were involved in the battles at the weekend  said the loss of the city was reflection of decade of neglect both by the Shia dominated central government and by exiled Sunni tribal leaders  We are exhausted  we want security and to be able to walk in our streets he said We are tired  we want peace  we want to live  and the government is run by thieves and ignorant people  know most of the decision makers in Anbar who pretended to be tribal leaders  They used to be shoeless and now they own streets in Jordan  They are sitting outside Anbar in Baghdad  Irbil  Jordan or Dubai and deciding our future by  the messaging service  Viber  We are not welcoming Hashd in our city  We won fight them if they enter  but we are emotionally against them  They are an ethnic militia who will treat us badly  The Hashd al Shaabi think they can win Ramadi as quickly they won Salaheddine  the province surrounding Tikrit  but that a lie because Salaheddine is small compared to Ramadi  It was surrounded by other areas which they had already won  while Ramadi is big city and is surrounded by desert  Shia militias led government troops in successful battle to reclaim Saddam Hussein home town of Tikrit in late March Along the way  though  the militias have faced persistent claims that some members have pursued sectarian agendas and committed abuses against some Sunni communities  While Hashd al Shabi has struck alliances with some Sunni tribes near Tikrit  it is distrusted by Sunni residents in Diyyala province  north of Baghdad  who claim its fighters are answerable to no state authority Hakim Zamili  member of the Iraqi parliament defence committee and leader of the Salam Brigades  Shia militia  said other Anbar tribes had been more circumspect about militias being sent to replace the vanquished national army  have just finished meeting with the leaders of Hashd al Shaabi  Iraqi generals and the defence minister and we have put plan to coordinate the fighting in Ramadi he said I have received many requests from the tribe leaders in Anbar asking us to bring the Hashd al Shaabi to defend them  Ihsan Shimari  Baghdad based political analyst  said the fall of Ramadi was wakeup call for Iraqi citizens who had been persuaded by the government that the campaign against Isis had been going well  especially since the reclaiming of Tikrit  Iraqis are easily misled by their emotions and they used to believe in quick victory  but now they are hit with harsh reality in Ramadi he said Now they believe that the war against Isis will be long and difficult  It took them long time to understand that brutal reality The militias dwarf Iraq embattled security forces in number and influence  With resolute backing from Iran  they have led the war against Isis since June  regularly taking primacy over Iraqi forces  to whom they readily cede credit for most battlefield successes  Hashd al Shaabi   are stronger because they are ideological said Shimari They are better organised and some of their brigades even have better weapons than the Iraqi army  Naim al Ubaidi  leader of Asaib ahl al Haq  one of the militias that plays leading role under the Hashd al Shaabi banner  said The Iraqi government asked us last night to intervene and rescue the city  We know that decision came late and we warned  the prime minister  Haidar  al Abadi that they won achieve victory without us  but we know that he was under pressure from the Americans to not let us be involved in this operation  All the brigades are now gathering their elite fighters to go for the battle in Ramadi and we are expecting the rescue the city within few days  The fighting in Ramadi will be easier for us than the operations in Salaheddine because of the collaboration of the tribes  Ramadi has fallen under the eyes of the Americans and they haven done anything  This isn like what happened in Irbil when the Americans intervened there and prevented the fall of Irbil at all costs  This tells us that Iraqis are the ones who should deal with their problems together and get united to fight their enemies  The US military said it had carried out nine air strikes as Isis advanced and officials in Washington said they were confident that the city could be retaken with their ongoing air support If so  that would almost certainly mean that the US would be flying in support of militia forces  rather than the national army  Asa ib ahl al Haq and the Jeish al Mehdi  both strong allies of Iran  were two of the US military most formidable foes from    accounting for more than   of its casualties  according to figures provided by Washington The US relationship with Iraq Sunnis was at times equally fraught  However  it reached high point in Anbar in   when grassroots revolt was amplified by an increased presence of US troops  which curbed violence drastically in Anbar Sheik Saddon al Eifan  from the town of Amriyat al Fallujah  said We in Anbar need any help we can get to get rid of Isis  They are attacking every family who fought against them and seeking revenge from everyone  We are now between two bad choices but we prefer the Hashd  and once they kick out Isis from our city we will ask them to leave  We need the Americans

Trigger warning   shocking truths about gun violence,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/gun-violence-waco-texas-shot,world,Eight years ago it was estimated there were at least  guns in the world  Today  if you include antique and homemade guns  that number is probably greater  fed by gun and ammunition industries across more than   countries  Police forces worldwide are said to have about m firearms  Armies are thought to hold about   Civilians  though  claim the rest and are by far the biggest owners of guns  About bn bullets are produced every year  almost enough to kill every person on the planet twice Estimates suggest there are about   violent deaths annually     of these are thought to be at the end of gun  If you take into account that  at bare minimum  for each person shot and killed  three will survive  about     people are shot by someone else every year Such global figures mask regional horrors  In Puerto Rico  for instance  about   of homicides are committed with firearm  Brazil  with more than    gun homicides year  has the most firearm deaths in the world  And San Pedro Sula  in Honduras  has the burden of being known as the most violent city in the world outside war zone  with murder rate of   per    This weekend gun battle between rival biker gangs in Waco  Texas  underlines the fact that in certain areas of the US  gang homicide rates are over   times the murder rate among the wider population  Without doubt  the right to bear arms fuels this extremely high level of violence  To put these figures in perspective  the England and Wales homicide rate is less than one per    with only  of those killed by guns The majority of those shot are men  Globally  male homicide rates are almost four times that of women  Women account for the majority of domestic violence gun killings  but in some places  the gender disparity in terms of overall armed violence is stark  The World Health Organisation reported in  male homicide rates at about  times greater than female rates in Brazil   times in Honduras and  times in Venezuela  In Venezuela  of those killings were with gun The WHO estimates that more than   people kill themselves each year  and one commonly used way is with firearm  There are no concrete figures on how many people shoot themselves globally  but we know the prevalence of guns in society affects how people choose to take their lives  So in England and Wales  with its tight gun laws  only  of suicides are gun deaths  In the US  with almost as many guns as there are people  gun suicides account for the majority of all suicides more than    year  Indeed  there were  American children under the age of  who shot themselves in  Guns play role in this  In   the Israeli Defence Force witnessed disturbing number of suicides in its ranks  In an effort to reduce this number  the IDF banned soldiers from taking rifles home on the weekends  Suicides fell by  An army review later concluded Decreasing access to firearms significantly decreases rates of suicide among adolescents  The US has more guns per person than any other country in the world  Stemming from constitutional right to bear arms  it has given birth to an industry that in  helped sustain quarter of million jobs  directly or indirectly  creating  bn in annual economic activity Today  at almost    there are about  times more federally licensed sellers in the US than there are McDonald  They have plenty to sell more than   guns were manufactured in the US in      rise from decade before  This does not include the  guns imported into the US that year Where there are more guns  there are more gun deaths  The US has the highest per capita rate of firearm murders of all developed countries  While figures are hard to come by  data from the Center for Disease Control shows that in  there were as many as   non fatal intentional shootings in the US  the lowest estimate was    That year saw    fatal shootings  including suicides  The data offers stark reading  In   FBI figures show   people under the age of  killed by guns in the US   of them under five years old  More American teenagers and children were killed that year by gunfire than US military in any given year in Iraq or Afghanistan As guns have evolved through the centuries  so too have medical responses to the injuries sustained from them  In the th century  gunpowder harm caused doctors to believe bullets were contaminants  This led to the practice of burning the wound to rid the body of poison  By the American war of independence     surgeons were suggesting that  if gunshot wound was to be sewn up  piece of onion was best put inside  and the wound reopened after one or two days By the Crimean war of the    though  Florence Nightingale efforts to clean hospitals had notable impact on patient mortality  which dropped from   to  Joseph Lister experiments applying carbolic acid to wounds also helped reduce death rates  And Roentgen development of the ray in  helped pinpoint fabric  bullets and bone fragments  The impact of these discoveries was revolutionary  research into the Spanish American war in  suggests that   of US casualties survived Medical innovations in gunshot trauma continues today  Tranexamic acid  used to ease heavy menstrual flow  has also helped save the lives of haemorrhaging gunshot patients  Syringes containing tiny sponges can stem gunshot wound in seconds We ve seen that where there are more guns  there are more gun deaths  Iceland  however  is different  About  of the Icelandic population belongs to gun club  and an estimated    guns exist in this land of about third of million people  putting it about th in the world ranking of guns per capita  But whereas in      people were murdered in Brazil and    people were estimated killed in the US  only one person died violently in Iceland So rare an event is murder that when  in    year old man was shot dead by Icelandic police  the incident was major scandal  mainly because it was the first time the country police force had shot and killed anybody  ever  The fact that the police generally do not carry guns  small population  strict gun registration laws  close knit community spirit  and liberal punitive legal system partly explain why Iceland unusual relationship with guns Much is made about the bloody impact of assault rifles and high powered guns  Mother Jones reported that between  and  over half of the  US mass shooters examined killed using guns with high capacity magazines  assault weapons  or both  The reality  though  is that pistols and revolvers are used in the vast majority of gun killings  In Sa Paulo  one report found   of firearm murder weapons were handguns  FBI data from  shows over   of gun murders in the US where the firearm was identified were with handguns  We might well focus on semi automatic rifles being used in shootings  but it the handgun we should really be worried about Many studies have concluded that having gun in the marital home puts women at greater risk than men  In the US  women are estimated to be  times more likely to be murdered with gun than women in any other developed country  Perhaps this is not that surprising when you take into account that only nine states in the US prevent people jailed for stalking from buying gun  once they are released  In   it was estimated that almost    convicted stalkers in the US were still permitted to carry gun under federal law  American gun control pressure groups  like Everytown  also claim the presence of gun makes it five times  more likely that domestic violence will turn into murder  Despite this  gun lobbyists push the line that gun makes woman safer  Wayne LaPierre  the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association  has said that  the one thing violent rapist deserves is good woman with gun And gunmaker Glock Wrong Girl advert  where young woman foils would be attacker  explicitly extols that fact  This despite the fact that  as comprehensive American scientific review concluded There is compelling evidence that gun in the home is risk factor for intimidation and for killing women in their homes  In July   US government report found   of the serial numbers of   weapons given to the Afghan national army by the US Department of Defense could not be accounted for or had been duplicated  In Iraq  the Pentagon lost track of about   rifles and pistols given to the Iraqi security forces  And this year  US officials claimed the Pentagon was unable to account for more than   in military aid to Yemen What happened to all of these guns is unknown  But ammunition magazines  identical to those given to Afghan government forces by the US  have been found on dead Taliban fighters  and US made firearms have been captured from Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria It is not just the likes of Isis that has been armed with American guns  About   US guns are estimated to cross into Mexico annually  The US government also found that   of firearms traced in Costa Rica and   in Belize in  were either manufactured in or imported into the US This wave of guns has had consequences  There were   homicides estimated to have taken place in Mexico between  and    mainly with American guns  About   of traced guns there were found to have come from the US  And in the four years following the lifting of semi automatic firearm restrictions in the US there have been an estimated   additional homicides in Mexico  Such are the international consequences of America love for the gun When  people were murdered in Aramoana  New Zealand  lifetime gun licences were replaced by  year ones  The massacre of  in Erfurt  Germany in  led to the psychological screening of buyers under the age of   And in Australia in   the Port Arthur massacre paved the way for general ban of semi automatic weapons and nationwide gun buyback scheme Such is the trend globally  mass shooting leads to public debate about the need for tighter gun controls and politicians respond The US  though  is the only country in the world where  following mass shooting  the nation has responded with loosening  not tightening  gun laws  After  people were killed in mass shooting in Texas in   the state pushed through law permitting the carrying of concealed weapons  Even the murder of  children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December  saw call for fewer  not more gun law restrictions  It was reported year later by PBS that  American states had passed  laws expanding gun rights  including measures that let people carry concealed weapons in churches and campuses  or even to use them in self defence when drunk  Some schools even now allow their teachers to go armed Has this made the US safer  Many say not  In the  months before Sandy Hook  there were  gun deaths in US schools  In  months following Sandy Hook   deaths were reported An Oklahoma company even came up with solution  They sell bullet resistant blankets to protect schoolchildren a pad that they claim protects against   of all weapons used in school shootings   Iain Overton is the director of policy and investigations at

BBC demands explanation for arrest of crew investigating Qatar World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/bbc-demands-explanation-for-arrest-of-crew-investigating-qatar-world-cup,world,The BBC is demanding full explanation from the Qatari authorities after its journalists were detained for two days while investigating the situation of migrant workers before the  World Cup A four strong BBC crew had been invited by the prime minister office on an official tour designed to show off new accommodation for migrant labourers  but were arrested by the security services while trying to gather additional material  They were interrogated and jailed for two days  before being released without charge The BBC Middle East correspondent  Mark Lobel  was one of those detained  along with his cameraman  driver and translator  Lobel said his interrogators never explained why he had been held but showed him surveillance photographs of his movements in Qatar They had actually photographed my every move since arrived he said The visit was part of public relations drive  partly overseen by London based agency Portland  in the wake of an international outcry over the slave like conditions for workers exposed by Guardian investigation in September  Since December   when Qatar won the right to stage the  World Cup  its government has come under intense criticism for the poor conditions in which many of  migrants live and work The government defended the arrests and said the BBC crew were trespassing  German film crew were detained last month while making documentary  after being accused of not having valid permit The BBC team were detained the week before last  but news of the incident only emerged on Monday  The journalists were later allowed to take part in the official tour of migrant accommodation block but their equipment has not been returned  We are pleased that the BBC team has been released but we deplore the fact that they were detained in the first place  Their presence in Qatar was no secret and they were engaged in perfectly proper piece of journalism said BBC spokesperson  The Qatari authorities have made series of conflicting allegations to justify the detention  all of which the team rejects  We are pressing the Qatari authorities for full explanation and for the return of the confiscated equipment  Fifa  which has come under fire for failing to use the leverage of the World Cup to press for changes to labour laws  said Any instance relating to an apparent restriction of press freedom is of concern to Fifa and will be looked into with the seriousness it deserves  The Qatari government head of communications  Saif al Thani  said the BBC crew were arrested after departing from an official tour  He said We gave the reporters free rein to interview whomever they chose and to roam unaccompanied in the labour villages  Perhaps anticipating that the government would not provide this sort of access  the BBC crew decided to do their own site visits and interviews in the days leading up to the planned tour  In doing so  they trespassed on private property  which is against the law in Qatar just as it is in most countries  Security forces were called and the BBC crew was detained  He said other media outlets were able to report freely from the same camp the following day The Guardian was not present on the media tour but toured the same labour camps later that week with the assistance of Portland and the Qatari authorities  as well as visiting other camps unaccompanied Qatari authorities insist they are committed to reform but human rights groups have been critical of the pace of change since the dire situation for many migrant workers  whose numbers are expected to swell to  within the next five years  was exposed by the Guardian and others Despite some new accommodation and new law requiring wages to be paid electronically  there has been little progress towards reform of the kafala sponsorship system that ties workers to their employers Nor has the government made progress on cataloguing the number of deaths and injuries among migrant workers  many of whom arrive in the country already heavily in debt due to unscrupulous recruitment agents Florian Bauer  one of the four journalists from German broadcaster ARD detained last month after unsuccessfully attempting to acquire shooting permit  said it took three and half weeks for his team to have their equipment returned You do have responsibility if you want to host these big sporting events to open yourself up to scrutiny he said Trade unions and pressure groups also stepped up pressure on World Cup sponsors and Fifa to do more to improve workers rights and conditions Sharan Burrow  the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation  ITUC said We remind people constantly it a police state  We have seen journalists harassed  journalists who have told us their stories  It is extraordinary they have gone to these lengths  It the police state operating as it does without the PR company having knowledge of it  The ITUC has been particularly virulent in its criticism of Qatar labour laws and was part of new drive launched on Monday to persuade Fifa sponsors  including Adidas  Coca Cola and McDonalds  to put pressure on Qatar to change The initiative  co ordinated by the chairman of sportswear brand Skins  Jaimie Fuller  was also backed by Tory MP Damian Collins You ve seen the conditions the workers are living in  If McDonalds beef cattle lived in those conditions you wouldn buy their burgers so why should we expect the men building the facilities that will host the tournament they sponsor to be living in those conditions said Collins  who fronts an organisation called NewFifaNow  The same applies to the rest of the sponsors  It not acceptable to turn blind eye  Fifa has blood on its hands  as do the sponsors  for as long as they continue to turn blind eye to what is going on there  
French police arrest dozen over carjacking of Saudi prince motorcade,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/french-police-arrest-dozen-suspects-saudi-carjacking,world,French police arrested about dozen suspects in connection with spectacular robbery on the convoy of Saudi prince in Paris last year that netted the thieves          The suspects were picked up in the Paris region and are now in custody  police source told AFP The source said some of the suspects had been quickly identified after the carjacking  but that investigators lacked evidence to arrest them Months of work probing the suspects  finances provided enough evidence to lead to the wave of arrests on Monday The attack on the prince convoy took place in August in northern Paris as the motorcade was making its way from plush hotel on the Champs Elyse es to an airport in Le Bourget A gang of between five and eight thieves in two BMWs hijacked the first of about  vehicles in the convoy  driving off with the three occupants before letting them go  police said The Saudis  Mercedes and one of the thieves  BMWs were later found abandoned and burned out in the village of Saint Mesmes  to the north east of Paris  about km   miles  from the scene of the crime Police found two  notes  documents in Arabic  and medication near the burnt out wrecks of the two cars  The thieves also made off with  sensitive  diplomatic documents At the time  police described the attack as  unusual  and said the assailants were  obviously well informed  No one was hurt in the attack Airport sources said the prince was Abdul Aziz Bin Fahd  the multimillionaire youngest son of King Fahd  who died in  The prince  who has something of playboy reputation  was apparently already at Le Bourget when the convoy was attacked  Despite the raid  he took off for an unknown destination

Tension high before ruling on Center Parcs village in ancient French forest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/tension-high-before-ruling-on-center-parcs-village-in-ancient-french-forest,world,On the edge of an ancient forest in remote corner of south eastern France  spray painted sign marked the entrance to the  free zone  An abandoned forestry house had been transformed into squatted operations centre called  the fortress Men and women were building wooden structures  planting small vegetable patches and surveying map of  barricades  built deep into the woodland  This is the frontline in the latest battle over the heart and soul of the French countryside  protest movement to stop the construction of Center Parcs holiday village in the Forest of Chambaran in Ise re  Why would you destroy such calm and beautiful bit of nature to build an artificial holiday village of bungalows crammed with thousands of people around tropical dome with heated pool asked one protester in her s who had been squatting at the site for several months This is an important environmental area  We won leave until we ve stopped this industrial tourism project going ahead One banner summed up her position No to the violence of leisure  For eight years  Center Parcs the woodland holiday camp concept known for its family bungalows and giant transparent domes containing pools and jacuzzis has been planning to build holiday village of nearly   cottages on   hectare site in this remote forest  The project sits at the edge of the small village of Roybon about  miles from Grenoble  which has population of   people  and is surrounded by breathtaking landscapes of high plateaus and rolling grassy hills against mountain backdrop But Center Parcs Europe which is owned by the French holiday giant Pierre Vacances  and is separate from Center Parcs UK has come up against determined opposition First came court challenges from local citizens  association  Pour les Chambaran sans Center Parcs  as well as fishermen and the environmental group Frapna  which warned against building on an environmentally sensitive area of forest it described as an  entirely natural space unchanged by humans for   years A consultative public inquiry reached an  unfavourable  conclusion on the project  citing laws protecting water  But the prefect of Grenoble ruled that the project should go ahead and approved the start of forest clearing six months ago Protesters swiftly occupied the site  linking arms in front of diggers or standing next to trees that were to be cut down  While the court decisions are pending  work is on hold and activists continue to camp out in cabins and tree houses  The next court judgments are expected in the coming weeks but it is uncertain when or if work will resume and tension is high In his stone farmhouse across the valley  Re mi  beekeeper and father of three  described being among the first to head into the forest to prevent workmen cutting down trees I felt there was no choice but to opt for non violent direct action it was civil disobedience he said The environmental aspect is crucial  But m also opposed to the economic model of the extreme merchandising of the countryside  It also about democracy and the role of local politicians imposing this on us without proper consultation  The Socialist government is watching closely because this is the latest in growing French movement of squatted  occupation  camps opposing big building projects in rural areas  These countryside protest squats are called zones  de fendre  defence zones  under the acronym ZAD  and the squatters are known as zadistes Another contested site an airport project in Notre Dame des Landes near Nantes has seen violent confrontations between police and demonstrators  Last October  at standoff over the Sivens dam project in southern France   year old protester  Re mi Fraisse  was killed by police stun grenade in what Ce cile Duflot  the Green former housing minister  called  an indelible stain  on the government  In May   the focus of young French protesters was mostly in cities and towns  where we were debating democracy and hierarchies  Now it these big industrial projects in the countryside that are the focus of youth protests said Jean Marie Brun  who has run horse riding and psychotherapy centre in Roybon for  years Brun opposed the Center Parcs project for environmental reasons but also questioned the very spirit of holiday villages where tourists were enclosed in compound What makes people happy is getting to know one another  not closing people off behind fence  In the village of Roybon  now dubbed the  Forest of Discord  by the media  the atmosphere has turned sour  with animosity between those who favour the Center Parcs resort and those who oppose it  Many locals in favour argue that Center Parcs will bring much needed jobs  with the rightwing mayor telling journalists that it is an  amazing opportunity  for employment and local tax revenues Banners saying  Yes to Center Parcs  hang outside certain shops and homes  with  No to Center Parcs  outside other houses beyond the village centre  The no camp says the public forest land was sold off too cheaply to the developers while the village accounts were in debt  and that environmental issues must be taken into consideration Christian Luciani  an architect from Grenoble who has lived in Roybon for  years  heads Vivre en Chambaran  local association in favour of Center Parcs  which staged  Yes to Center Parcs  marches in December after the site was occupied by protesters He had hoped the arrival of the holiday village would create what he called an  Olympic Games effect  where public services would be developed and investment would follow There a fear of our village slowly dying and shops closing  everything shrinking he said There one cashpoint  but even that might get closed  Center Parcs represents an opportunity  A spokeswoman for Pierre Vacances  which has five Center Parcs holiday villages in France and is building more  said We have respected all environmental laws and regulations  and we have responded to each point raised in the public inquiry  Center Parcs has always been tourist destination based on nature villages with concern for the environment  At his house set in rolling hills looking towards the forest where the Center Parcs would be built  Ste phane Peron  head of the opposition group

Qatar PR efforts on labour scandal backfire with BBC team detention,https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/may/18/qatars-pr-efforts-labour-scandal-backfire-bbc-detention,world,Professional public relations advice doesn come cheap and it is tribute to Qatar that it has invested in one of the best providers in the business  London based Portland Communications  which began working for the Doha government year ago for what is widely rumoured to be an eye watering amount of money In per capita terms the Gulf state is the wealthiest country in the world  with vast natural gas reserves  tiny native population far outstripped by an army of migrant workers and ambitions crowned by its controversial bid to host the  World Cup  Its eye catching global investments from Harrods to Paris St Germain football club have been matched by an effort to punch above its weight politically in the Middle East  backing Islamist movements in particular Yet its recent experience has disproved the old maxim that there is no such thing as bad publicity  The World Cup bid has drawn attention to the appalling conditions in which Asian labourers live and work  while the turmoil of the Arab spring has exposed Qatar to charges of supporting extremist groups fighting in Syria  Neither  to put it mildly  have helped burnish the emirate modern image News of the arrest of BBC team invited to see improvements for foreign workers is damaging too and will doubtless have the Portland PR team grinding their teeth in frustration  It is ironic that an effort to show that Qatar is responding to complaints from trade unions  the International Labour Organisation and human rights watchdogs such as Amnesty International has backfired so badly Qatari officials acknowledge that Guardian coverage of the migrant labour story has been an important spur to change  Abdullah al Khulaifi  labour minister  told me he had had nightmares as result and felt unfairly criticised  but was still keen to highlight positive reforms improved standards of workers  accommodation  wage payment methods and the enforcement of other rules The downside is that there is still no timetable for the promised abolition of the controversial kafala  sponsorship  system which prevents workers from changing jobs for five years and leaves them open to abuse and doubts about whether the proposed changes amount to much more than cosmetic tinkering or rebranding The detention of the BBC journalist Mark Lobel is doubly embarrassing because he had been invited on press trip that was designed to showcase progress  The Guardian was able to undertake similar officially arranged tour with Portland help  but also managed to visit workers  housing in Doha grim industrial zone without an escort and  happily  without being detained by security personnel The story illustrates wider problem  Under the emir  Sheikh Tamim  who took over after his father abdication two years ago  powerful elements of the Qatari government are committed to reform and to more transparent communications strategy  Others  clearly  are not  It is no coincidence that the kafala system remains the responsibility of the interior ministry  not Khulaifi more image conscious ministry of labour Qatar is no democracy but it does not feel like police state  Yet following reporters  covertly photographing them and throwing them into prison are not normally used to prevent trespassing as the government claimed in professional looking press release that bore the imprint of Portland expertise  PR has its uses  up to point  but it cannot be substitute for genuine openness

UK to offer drones to help combat people smugglers in Libya,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/uk-drones-combat-people-smugglers-libya,world,The British government is expected to offer to supply drones and intelligence gathering equipment and to set up military headquarters to combat people smugglers operating in Libya  official sources say The British foreign secretary  Philip Hammond  and the defence secretary  Michael Fallon  had been expected to tell their EU counterparts at meeting in Brussels on Monday that Britain is prepared to take the lead in operations in the Mediterranean  But on Monday afternoon defence sources said that instead  the UK would offer what they called  planning specialist staff  A military package is shaping up to be the government response to the growing migrant boat crisis and pressure from its European partners to accept more refugees  robust military contribution could head off calls for the UK to take on more refugees and migrants Defence sources said Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship  Lyme Bay  which can carry   marines and three Merlin helicopters  and new class of armoured offshore assault boats  could provide significant element to planned EU naval force in the Mediterranean However  the sources said such force would need UN security council resolution and that the government would need much more information about the proposed EU force and its rules of engagement before deploying ships and commandos EU ministers are set to approve plans for the force on Monday  The move to fight people smugglers in the Mediterranean comes after series of shipwrecks killed hundreds of migrants The operation  starting in June  will involve the deployment of warships and surveillance aircraft off the coast of Libya  which is at the centre of the humanitarian disaster The EU plan also includes the possible destruction of smugglers  boats before they reach European shores Federica Mogherini  the EU diplomatic chief  said approval from the European foreign and defence ministers at  very intense  meeting in Brussels on Monday would help push the UN security council into backing action  Today the main point will be taking the decision to establish the EU operation at sea to dismantle the criminal networks that are smuggling people in the Mediterranean Mogherini told reporters I think that after we take the decision today it is more likely for the security council to take resolution  However  she has insisted there is no question of EU  boots on the ground  in Libya  where political chaos and the rising threat of Islamic State militants make it the main launching point for people risking their lives to cross the sea More than   migrants  many escaping civil war in Syria  have died over the past  months while trying to cross from North Africa  often on flimsy rubber dinghies or crowded fishing boats Britain  France  Germany  Italy and Spain have already promised to deploy warships for the mission  rare joint military venture for the  nation European bloc that prefers political and financial gambits The German defence minister  Ursula von der Leyen  said that while rescue operations at sea would remain the EU first priority  it had to tackle the roots of the problem Even if sea rescue operations will stay our top priority  we have to address at the same time the causes  which bring people to venture on this high risk escape over the sea she said However  rights groups have criticised the military plan  saying it would not solve the problem of complex smuggling networks and of huge number of people fleeing war and poverty  Andrew Stroehlein of Human Rights Watch said it was  utter madness  The headquarters of the mission  called EU Navfor Med  is to be in Rome and will be led by Italian rear admiral Enrico Credendino  European diplomat told AFP Brussels wants to take the operation step by step  starting by collecting intelligence on the traffickers by using radar  satellite pictures and reconnaissance flights and raiding unflagged boats If the EU wants ships from its member states to enter Libyan waters or capture boat flying foreign flag  it needs the green light from the UN under international law The naval operation is part of wider EU blueprint launched last week  which envisaged sharing the migrant burden more evenly among member states and increased cooperation with source countries to help stem the tide of people seeking better life in Europe  Pressure has grown on governments to act after an overcrowded migrant boat sank in the Mediterranean last month  leaving more than   dead in case that sparked international outrage But parts of the plan particularly quotas for distributing asylum seeker arrivals around the EU are causing deep divisions  Britain says it will not take part in the quota system and has called for economic migrants to be pushed back to where they came from It received unexpected support from the French prime minister  Manuel Valls  who rejected the quota plan at the weekend  while Hungary  Poland  the Czech Republic  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania and Slovakia have also spoken out against it

Fifa to investigate arrest of BBC news team in Qatar,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/fifa-to-investigate-arrest-of-bbc-news-team-in-qatar,world,Football governing body  Fifa  has launched an investigation after BBC news team was arrested in Qatar while reporting on the plight of migrant workers building stadiums for the  World Cup The four strong crew had been invited by the Qatari prime minister office on an official tour of new accommodation for construction workers  It was part of public relations drive in the wake of an international outcry over the slave like conditions for workers exposed by Guardian investigation But despite official permission to report in Qatar  the crew were arrested by the security services  interrogated and jailed for two days before being released without charge The Qatari government defended the arrests and accused the BBC crew of trespassing Fifa  which has been repeatedly criticised for the way Qatar won the bid to host the  World Cup  was helping to run the tour  It said it was investigating the arrests Any instance relating to an apparent restriction of press freedom is of concern to Fifa and will be looked into with the seriousness it deserves it said in statement The BBC Middle East correspondent  Mark Lobel  was one of those detained  along with his cameraman  driver and translator Speaking about his ordeal  Lobel said his interrogators never explained why he had been detained but showed him surveillance photographs of his movements in Qatar They had actually photographed my every move since arrived Lobel told BBC Radio s Today programme After their release  members of the team were allowed to take part in the official tour of migrant accommodation block but their equipment remained confiscated and Qatar has offered no explanation or apology for the arrests  We are fine Lobel said The worrying sign of this is that it might be crackdown on the media to deal with the problem at the same time that other parts of the government are trying to change their image  In an article for BBC News  he added Whatever the explanation  Qatar Jekyll and Hyde approach to journalism has been exposed by the spotlight that has been thrown on it after winning the World Cup bid  Qatar head of communications  Saif al Thani  said the BBC crew were arrested after departing from an official tour  He said We gave the reporters free rein to interview whomever they chose and to roam unaccompanied in the labour villages  Perhaps anticipating that the government would not provide this sort of access  the BBC crew decided to do their own site visits and interviews in the days leading up to the planned tour  In doing so  they trespassed on private property  which is against the law in Qatar just as it is in most countries  Security forces were called and the BBC crew was detained  No apology was issued  but Thani added The problems that the BBC reporter and his crew experienced could have been avoided if they had chosen to join the other journalists on the press tour  They would have been able to visit in broad daylight the very camps they tried to break into at night  Reporters from the Associated Press  AFP  the Guardian and Le Monde have filed stories on what they saw and heard in Qatar  and we invite interested readers to review their reports  which are available online   By trespassing on private property and running afoul of Qatari laws  the BBC reporter made himself the story  We sincerely hope that this was not his intention  Moreover  we deeply regret that he was unable to report the real story  which is that the government and the private sector are making significant progress in efforts to improve the lives and the labour conditions of guest workers in Qatar  Human Rights Watch  which has highlighted Qatar poor record on labour conditions  described the arrests as  jaw droppingly awful PR It pointed out that last week German television crew was also arrested on tour of Qatar HRW Gulf researcher Nicholas McGeehan said Qatar put itself in the harshest of spotlights when it won the right to host  and this is not the way to deal with the inevitable press attention  If it wants to put an end to media criticism  it needs to make some serious reforms to its labour system  Claiming that the arrest and intimidation of BBC journalists was legitimate on account of their  trespassing  is probably the lowest point so far in dismal series of PR disasters

How one NGO exposed contradictions at the heart of Putin foreign agent law,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/russia-putin-foreign-agent-ngo-contradictions,world,The human rights group Committee Against Torture has been declared  foreign agent  by Russian judge  who accused the group of trying to change state policy It become dreaded label for the NGO sector in Russia since Vladimir Putin introduced law clamping down on organisations who receive funding from abroad But for Committee Against Torture  CAT the move initiated an perplexing legal process that exposed the contradictions at the heart of the law  By accusing the group of trying to change policy  prosecutors were forced to implicate the state in the use of torture  when it is in fact outlawed in Russia In challenging the label  CAT and the court became tangled in debate at times leaning on the philosophical about the hopelessly broad tenets that lie at the centre of the law  over what constitutes  state policy  and  political activity terms which have been applied in damaging trials against NGOs on case by case basis The group founder  Igor Kalyapin  explained the incongruity of the state accusation to Russian media By the prosecutors  logic  it turns out that state policy is torture in police departments and the covering up of torture by investigative bodies he said The human rights organisation was established in  and aims to raise awareness of torture and degrading treatment in Russia  In the past  years it has worked on   cases of mistreatment and prompted   unlawful decisions to be annulled  organisers say  Its investigations have also resulted in   officials in the law enforcement agencies being convicted If CAT was undermining state policy by uncovering cases of torture  then torture itself must be state policyBut in December   the prosecutor for the Nizhny Novgorod region  Oleg Panasenko  ordered the organisation to register as  foreign agent claiming it had tried to change state policy by broadcasting information about its campaigns and activities Panasenko accused the human rights advocates of preparing and distributing  statements  papers and reports  demonstrating  torture is commonplace occurrence in Russian institutions  In spreading such information  the prosecutor argued it was attempting to  attract attention and create negative public sentiment  The accusations raised an interesting legal paradox  as far as the prosecution was concerned  if the organisation could be deemed to be undermining state policy it followed that torture itself must be state policy  The NGO  by this reckoning  qualified as  foreign agent  because it tried to do this with money received from foreign donors In court  Kalyapin asked the prosecution What is state policy regarding the use of torture  Does it aim to diffuse the practice or to eradicate it  The prosecution replied State policy is aimed at the eradication  of torture of course Are you saying that  the victims of torture constitute social group The opposing sides spent several hours debating the meaning of the term  and local political scientist  Sergei Ustinkin  was called to give evidence Ustinkin concluded that by  defending the interest of specific social group CAT could indeed be deemed to be engaged in political activity  Which group interests do we defend asked Kalyapin  knowing that the prosecutor was unable to formally recognise victims of state torture as social group Ustinkin tried to avoid answering Considering that we all have an interest  in seeing that  Russian laws are enforced by members of Russia law enforcement agencies he said CAT performs very important social and legal function  It defends those who have suffered violence at the hands of the Siloviki  politicians from the military or police services Kalyapin countered By your criteria  as far understand them  to engage in political activity we have to promote the interests of given social group  Are you saying that victims of torture constitute social group   Yes and no   well  yes Ustinkin said Kalyapin argued strongly that neither the prosecutors nor the specialist witnesses had put forward convincing case that CAT was undermining state policy in its investigation and support of victims of torture Instead  he said it was the inadequacy of Russia investigative committee and its reports on the use of torture which were at fault Torture is outlawed in Russia  but it is not explicitly defined in the country legal code and was traditionally prosecuted under article   Abuse of power and article   Coercion to give evidence Amnesty International says abuse and degrading treatment is routine in Russia prison and police detention On the basis of his NGO appeals  Kalyapin said that Russian judges had annulled more than   unlawful rulings by the investigative committee and prosecutors  who had refused to initiate criminal proceedings relating to torture  It was therefore the judges  he argued  not CAT who were making decisions that criticised state policy More than   of those rulings were overturned in the very court room Kalyapin was defending his organisation It is this court itself which offers negative assessment of the prosecutors and investigative authorities he argued  not CAT Kalyapin claimed his organisation objective was not to change policy  but to ensure that it was implemented effectively But the Russian courts had given him an ultimatum  he said Either stop doing what m doing  or  the court  will charge Committee Against Torture on the grounds that  as its head  am engaged in politics  That is absurd  Once labelled as foreign agents  organisations often struggle to gain access to government officials and public institutions  NGOs are also required to mark their publications with the term  and start any oral statement with disclosure that it is being delivered by foreign agent CAT wouldn survive these restrictions  Kalyapin said  and the result of the ruling would ultimately be the organisation destruction  he concluded The legal process is ongoing  CAT are appealing against the judge decision  and the organisation work continues  This week the group announced it would challenge the investigative committee refusal to allow one of its lawyers to consult Dadaev Zaur  suspected of killing opposition figure Boris Nemtsov  about the maltreatment he is allegedly receiving while in police custody A longer version of this interview first appeared in Russian on Novaya Gazeta  Translation by Cameron Johnston

Iran goes back to the future at Venice Biennale,https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/may/18/venice-biennale-iran-2015,world, All The World Futures  might be the overarching leitmotif of the th Venice Biennale  but Iran national pavilion  its largest ever at the prestigious contemporary art event  has chosen to frame its future through its past The first exhibition  entitled The Great Game  takes its inspiration from   th century tug war over the lands of Central Asia  The second  entitled Iranian Highlights  offers select mix of four Iranian contemporary artists who have forged very varied careers on the international stage over the past  years The two are intended to work in harmony  creating substantial whole united under Iran roof  They meld together to an extent that it is difficult to notice where one ends and the other begins This is all part of the plan  says Tandis Tanavoli  project manager for the Faiznia Family Foundation  non profit organization that is organizing the pavilion along with the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art The beauty of this exhibit is that the works chosen create story one story she says The Iran pavilion stands sentinel in former ship building factory between two canals at the very northernmost tip of the city  along the Calle San Giovanni deep in Venice Cannaregio district  The atmosphere is industrial  with paintings mounted on makeshift walls erected from sheets of white canvas and sculptures perched on the bare concrete floor The pavilion open interior creates seamless transition as visitors move between the two displays  Here  Iran has showcased  artists  Many are part of the larger of the shows  The Great Game  which brings together the work of artists from Iran and her neighboring Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries  including India  Pakistan  Afghanistan  Azerbaijan  Iraq and Kurdistan Curators Marco Meneguzzo and Mazdak Faiznia developed the concept behind The Great Game  The pair explained that it thrusts the contested and still pertinent geographies of the th century into the language of contemporary art  The theme might be more familiar to international audiences through Rudyard Kipling Kim  or Peter Hopkirk eponymous study of the geo political tussle between the British and Russians for the lands of Central Asia from  to   Iran was portrayed as the playfellow in satirical magazine prints of the time  the diminutive Persian cat to the burly British lion and Russian bear In keeping with festival director Okwui Ewenzor desire to articulate and heal the ruptures of history by focusing on the  current state of things The Great Game serves to underpin the common historical  geographical and artistic ties between Iranian artists and those from guest countries  Ever aware of the unfavourable media presentation of this part of the world into the st century  the curators have tried to create dialogue between viewers and works  enabling Biennale visitors to experience these regions through the eyes of the artists assembled instead of the rolling news  Introducing the public to new artists in order to challenge preconceptions about Iran and its neighbours is the overall prerogative Iran curatorial strategy this year allows forum for those countries swallowed up during the events of the past in which to not only articulate their enduring connections  but also their burgeoning artistic autonomy and national traumas  Visitors have been feverishly Instagramming the Iraqi born  Helsinki based artist Abdel Abidin phosphorescent m Sorry   As appealing as the light box signage is  framed by red  white and blue light bulbs like starlet dressing room mirror  the phrase is the apologetic response that the artist received when he revealed his nationality in conversation to the US citizens he encountered on his travels around America There has also been buzz surrounding the inclusion of the late Iranian painter and video artist Farideh Lashai  Her multimedia works  many of which were her last before her death in   are compellingly dark and ethereal  Lashai video painting Rabbit in Wonderland based on the aftermath of the  coup that overthrew Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh melds the uncertain reality of political events with the phantasmagoria of Lewis Carroll Alice in Wonderland  figure  perhaps Mossadegh himself  appears spectral  swathed in mournful robes of black and grey  Beside him hops an animated white rabbit  accompanying him down the rabbit hole of Iranian history The Great Game also presents an opportunity to see the collective works of some of the most celebrated Iranian contemporary artists  Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian mirror mosaics and the whirling calligraphic  Heech  sculptures for which Parviz Tanavoli is best known share floor space with each other  Around labyrinthine rooms within rooms  visitors stumble upon the monumental sliced columns of Nazgol Ansarinia beside works of photomontage by the late Sadegh Tirafkan  which unflinchingly explored issues of gender in modern Iran  Turning corner  Ahmadi Shahriar potent mix of weaponry and calligraphy see swords dangle as pendulous reminders of Iranian martyrdom The installation work of Ahovan Parastoo takes the pavilion to yet darker place  laying out history book dated  BC to the present day  only to puncture the golden lettering of its title with bullet hole  Perhaps with shared black humour  the pioneering Iraqi multimedia artist Wafaa Bilal is paired well with the Iranian sculptor Ghodratollah Agheli  both of whom present disconcerting golden busts within The Great Game  Bilal Canto III and Space Junk were part of    crowd funded project  which saw the artist send Saddam Hussein metallic likeness into space  Agheli Venus in Tragic Land    splices the human with the robotic in modern chimera  inserting video screens into monitors with female hands and faces  Drawing on shared artistic heritage  Indian sculptor Riyas Komu Fragrance of Funeral    and the Afghan painter Mohsen Taasha Wahidi with In the Seventh Sky    take figures from the traditions of Persianate painting and position them within deconstructed landscapes Although boundaries between the two are porous  The Great Game is followed by the Iranian Highlights exhibit the traditional showcase of national artists at the Biennale a choice selection of four Iranian painters  photographers and conceptual artists from across three generations  Iran divides the trajectory of its contemporary artists into three parts  Typifying the  Masters Mohammad Ehsai presents his famed canvases of calligraphy  which are here limited to bold and regal palate of red  black and white strokes  which swirl across shimmering golden backgrounds  Samira Alikhanzadeh is next  demonstrating the  second generation  of artists born in the    Toying with  past  and  present Alikhanzadeh infuses vintage photographs of women in     Iran with elements

Plan to reform WHO after Ebola to be unveiled by Angela Merkel,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/angela-merkel-plan-restructure-world-health-organisation,world,The decision to warn the world of future global disease epidemics like Ebola would be taken out of the hands of the director general of the World Health Organisation under plans formulated by experts at meeting hosted by Angela Merkel  the German chancellor  Instead it would be given to new semi autonomous body  within WHO but independent of its political currents Merkel will speak at the opening of the annual World Health Assembly in Geneva on Monday of the need for WHO reform to ensure there is prompt response to health emergencies that can impact on the entire world  There are two urgent issues that must be addressed in the interest of all nations  she believes the response to the event of pandemic and the fading powers of antibiotic drugs because of global overuse  She intends to push forward on both issues at the   which Germany chairs  in the summer The WHO slow response to Ebola has been universally condemned  The director general committee which can declare public health emergency was not convened until August  eight months after the first cases and five months after public warnings from Me decins Sans Frontie res  whose doctors were on the front line  Experts believe the Ebola disaster was wake up call and that there is now an unprecedented opportunity to make changes to WHO to ensure this never happens again There is now little appetite for replacing WHO  which was at first proposed by some critics  The meeting called by Merkel of world experts in Berlin some weeks ago instead believes that dedicated group with its own ring fenced funding and its own director should be established  It would report to the director general  currently Margaret Chan  but have high degree of independence  Its own external advisory board would decide whether disease outbreak is an epidemic of global concern and its director would have to act on that advice  which would be public and transparent The WHO dragged its feet over declaring Ebola public health emergency partly because it did not quickly have enough information to understand what was going on and partly for political reasons  There was fear that trade to the countries worst affected Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea would be badly affected and airlines would cancel flights  which turned out to be the case The new body would be responsible for ensuring all countries improve their disease surveillance systems  which are non existent in some parts of the poorest countries  Also up for discussion is an insurance scheme  which would offer the incentive of payouts to countries facing an economic hit if they declared an outbreak  The World Bank was represented at the Berlin meeting  The organisation would be responsible for setting global standards in terms of surveillance said Jeremy Farrar  director of the Wellcome Trust  who was also in Geneva for the assembly Because of its extra autonomy  it would be able to give public comment on how countries were meeting their responsibilities as part of the international health regulations  It could also be in charge of deploying the planned global health emergency workforce of doctors  nurses and logisticians who will be trained  prepared and on register for call up in the event of an epidemic Reform  said Farrar has to happen quite soon because everyone will start to forget quite quickly what happened  A panel commissioned by the WHO executive board into the Ebola response believes this is  defining moment for the work of WHO saying in its interim assessment last week that  business as usual  or  more of the same  is not an option Its report also says that new organisation to replace the WHO is not realistic We really think the effort and money and time would be better spent in getting WHO fit for purpose said Barbara Stocking  president of Murray Edwards College  Cambridge and former chief executive of Oxfam who chaired the panel The interim report will be discussed at the assembly on Tuesday  but the panel will not finish its assessment or put forward final recommendations until mid July  Stocking said  Good surveillance systems were vital  she said  and some sort of insurance scheme involving the World Bank would encourage countries that might be affected by epidemics to declare them It is an incentive for the countries and for WHO to say it she said  The other part of this is how we get other countries to behave appropriately The international health regulations require non affected countries to continue to trade and not to cut transport links unless WHO advises they should Forty countries this time went beyond what WHO said was necessary  At the moment  they have no teeth to do anything about it  
Minjee Lee star rises with maiden LPGA title at Kingsmill Championship,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/19/minjee-lee-maiden-lpga-title-kingsmill-championship,sport,Long touted as Australian golf next big thing  teenager Minjee Lee delivered with stunning final round surge to claim her maiden LPGA title at the weather delayed Kingsmill Championship Lee shot final round six under  on Monday at the River Course of the Kingsmill Resort in Williamsburg Virginia  over two days  to blast by the field and finish at  under par  good enough for two shot win over Korean So Yeon Ryu The round featured blistering stretch of five birdies and an eagle in just  holes  highlighting why many have been calling her the next Karrie Webb for some time The  year old former world No  amateur turned professional just eight months ago and had been experiencing mixed rookie season before the breakout win  but has now officially begun the chase of Webb  LPGA wins The West Australian product has been aware of the expectations of others but says it has not been factor in her early career  am extremely satisfied  didn really think about the expectation from others because put enough pressure on myself to perform well out here and this is great confidence booster moving forward Lee said  This win is not going to make it easy but it should allow me to just free up little bit to know can play well out here and win out here with my natural game  Lee  just the seventh player in history to win an LPGA event before her th birthday moves up to world No from  with the win and hopes she can now garner some consistency in her performance so she can challenge current No  Lydia Ko The Kiwi star  also   has seven LPGA titles on her resume She achieved so much at such young age with multiple wins and being world no  that a dream come true isn it  it what we all want to do and it is something for me to aspire to Lee said of Ko  It would be great if we could have rivalry but have lot of work still to do  The next step for me is becoming consistent contender on the tour  bringing it in with more top s and top fives and hopefully more wins  have to stay focussed on that process and those goals  For Webb  the result was far from shock  with the seven time major winner excited about the future ahead of her compatriot I don think anyone is surprised to see Minjee in the winners  circle Webb told AAP  This win will settle her little bit after an up and down start to her rookie season  It is quality win on quality course  We have to remember she only  with hopefully long and bright future  look forward to watching it  The win also guarantees Lee place in the upcoming US Open  timely bonus after the Monday finish meant she missed her tee time in the tournament qualifying event 
NRL  five things we learned from round ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/19/nrl-five-things-learned-round-10,sport,While the North Queensland Cowboys attract our admiration  and the St George Illawarra Dragons our surprise  the Melbourne Storm who endured tough examination from South Sydney on Saturday night are just getting on with doing what they ve been doing for the best part of  years now  After finishing sixth in  and dropping out of contention in the first week of finals  many  including me  expected them to struggle this season  to find themselves in scrap to make the top eight  While that may yet happen the ground looks solid under their feet  And that due  in large part  to the fact that Craig Bellamy didn sub contract the foundation laying to some charlatan in gold chains and lairy ute  Rather  he did it himself  and he a crosser and dotter if there ever was one It helps  of course  that Cameron Smith  Billy Slater and Cooper Cronk are his foremen  ones who do so much more than lean on shovels and direct play by pointing the cigarette in their mouths to the jobs that need doing  Yes  the Storm big three are getting on  and unless they uncover the elixir of youth sometime soon their powers will wane  but for now there life enough left in them  Slater  for instance  has been dynamite in the past fortnight  How the Kangaroos could have done with him two weeks ago  But here we are again at the door of the Origin period which  due to its demands on the Storm best  may yet cause them problem or two  Good thing Bellamy has them firing early  which has created four point buffer between them in equal first and the fifth placed team  Bellamy couldn have asked for more before the season kicked off For all the stick he gets Ricky Stuart has done well this year to turn around Canberra outfit that finished second last in   Going into their match against St George Illawarra on Sunday the Raiders had won four in row  run of form that would have had young Raiders fans breathing into paper bags to calm themselves down  having not seen the like before  Canberra loss to an impressive Dragons might have broken the Raiders  run and robbed them of possible top four spot going into the Origin period  but the Raiders were competitive and things might have been different had Jarrod Croker not had try disallowed for double movement in the opening minutes In the press conference Stuart made good wisecrack that  it looked like  Croker  Oz Tag tag fell off  and he had point  for while Tyson Frizell had hold of him  and Croker ball carrying arm made contact with the turf  at no point was his forward momentum halted  The rules on the matter A player in possession is tackled a  when he is  grounded and  held by one or more opposing players and the ball or the hand or arm holding the ball comes into contact with the ground aren a great help as they make no mention of momentum  and my gut feeling was the same as Stuart  that Croker wasn really  held  if you take held to mean that the tackler had him under control  Sometimes it would seem easier to do away with double movement altogether but perhaps that would be the first step to anarchy and before you know it there be pigs heads on stakes lining the sidelines The media begin talking about possible Origin selections and bolters in round one  if not earlier  You see  barnstorming performance from brilliant up and comer in the season opener has the same effect on us media spivs than doctor tapping on one patellar tendon has on the lower leg attached to it  But by round  all this reflexive jerking about gets too much  even for us  so we ll be as relieved as you are when  on Tuesday  both NSW and Queensland announce their squads for the series opener on  May  Until then  can help it we can wonder one last time about how much weight will be given to form and loyalty  If various reports are to be believed it looking increasingly likely that Mitchell Pearce will make his return to Origin in the Blues  No  jersey  despite Josh Reynolds being the incumbent in winning team  and despite Canberra Blake Austin being the form New South Welshman in the five eighth position this season  Trent Hodkinson is tipped to partner him in the halves  although will the criticisms of his game against the Roosters on Friday night by Blues legends Andrew Johns and Brad Fittler change Laurie Daley mind assuming it was already made up For Queensland  who will always seem more settled side as long as Messrs Slater  Inglis  Thurston  Smith  Cronk  Myles and Scott are going around  outside forces injury and suspension  that is are their main concern this time of year  So the Maroons  camp will be mightily relieved after hooker Cameron Smith was  on Monday  cleared to play in Game despite receiving grade one charge for kicking Issac Luke in the head  twice  during the Storm win against South Sydney at AAMI Park on Saturday night  Whether the judiciary showed leniency towards Smith because they deemed it accidental  or due to the identity of his victim  or whether they didn want to rub Smith out of Origin because they couldn bear the tsunami of conspiracy theories that would emerge from Queensland in flood  we can only speculate mischievously  Either way  relief is at hand If Monday night mongrel of match between the Manly Sea Eagles and Penrith Panthers had face it would be the kind that demands hessian sack  and if Ivan Cleary can manage to watch it again on replay he deserves raise  And he the coach of the winning team  How Penrith came away winning   at Brookvale is anyone guess for they did all they could to lose it  first allowing Manly  boosted by some vintage form from Brett Stewart  who is increasingly resembling Jason Lee from My Name Is Earl  or either   pool man with aspirations for an amateur film career to scoot away to    lead at the half  and then doing everything they could in the second half not to win At least six times in the last  minutes they dropped the ball in good field position  Apisai Koroisau the culprit on couple of occasions  and Waqa Blake on another  with the line wide open  In the end Cleary was pulled from outright despair by Jamie Soward flick pass that allowed Sika Manu to set up Dallin Watene Zelezniak for the game only second half try  and finally by late m drop kick from Matt Moylan  rare light in the gloom  That he and the Panthers didn even celebrate it suggests they were almost embarrassed to take the lead  It will take Cleary few days to clear his head after tonight performance but when the fog lifts he ll at least be able to find consolation in the two points gained  Poor Geoff Toovey will have no such luck We re only  games into the season so any talk of grand finals is premature  but what the heck  had Friday night Cowboys Broncos clash been the season decider only those from the deepest hollers of Brisbane would have demanded their money back  It was fast  frenetic and of high standard  and it took standout performance from Michael Morgan  and exceptional control from North Queensland they completed  from  sets to win it  Given those statistics Brisbane shouldn feel too disappointed  and Wayne Bennett said as much  The Cowboys  meanwhile  won be getting carried away but they must feel invincible at the moment  That seven on the trot and  in the mostly flat terrain of the NRL where upsets happen so often as to call into question their description as upsets  that impressive Both teams now share the competition lead  on  points alongside St George Illawarra and Melbourne  and it bears considering that they could well meet in the decider in October  What pity that if this happens it will be in Sydney  thousand clicks  and then some  for the Cowboys  from their fans and the one of the game most passionate heartlands  Currently ANZ Stadium in Sydney is due to host the grand final up to and including  and though the NRL said last year it is considering moving the season decider out of Sydney  where it has been played since   unless you count the Super League grand final of   and d prefer not to it has yet to commit  But surely it would help sell the idea of growth and expansion if the decider were moved  ideally to suit the highest ranked grand final qualifier  as happens in the League Ground capacity would have to be taken into account  it would be retrograde move to play the grand final at Hunter Stadium  for instance  but stadia like Suncorp in Brisbane  Etihad in Melbourne and even Eden Park in Auckland would suit  If the Cowboys and Broncos do face off in this year decider the emptiness of Suncorp far to the north would only underline the need for change

IPL has reached judgment day and brilliant Bangalore look worth bet,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/18/ipl-bangalore-mumbai-chennai-qualifier,sport,Going into the final round of games last weekend  as many as six of the eight teams had realistic ambitions of finishing in the top two of the Indian Premier League table  For the first time in  game season  even the top side lost as many as five matches  and the final game between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians was effectively tussle to finish second and avoid sixth Mumbai  the tournament form team with seven wins in their last eight after starting  prevailed easily  leaving Hyderabad to reflect on the rain that cost them so dearly in their penultimate match against Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tom Moody  the Hyderabad coach  is hardly alone in thinking that Duckworth Lewis in its present guise just doesn work for matches reduced to six over hit out Topping the table were Chennai Super Kings  the only team to have made the play offs every single season since the tournament inception in   The spot fixing scandal and the conflict of interest issues relating to Srinivasan may have tarnished the brand but on the field  they are the Barcelona of the IPL  Like the Catalan club in the Champions League  you have to go back to  for their last triumph  but the core group remains so formidable that few will look past them in the big games Brendon McCullum has left for England and Test series  and Chennai will call on Michael Hussey in his place  Half decade ago  he was perhaps the most complete batsman in the game the World Twenty semi final heist against Pakistan providing ample proof  Now  he a ring rusty veteran who will turn  three days after the final on Sunday In scheduling quirk that is one of the major irritants about the competition  second placed Mumbai get to host the first qualifier against Chennai  The team that loses will get second chance in Ranchi  MS Dhoni hometown  against the winner of the Bangalore Rajasthan Royals eliminator  If the teams captained by Virat Kohli and Steven Smith are to go all the way  they ll have to summon up three wins in five days  Labour of Hercules in Indian midsummer heat and humidity Both Bangalore and Rajasthan  however  will just be glad that they re there  having routinely missed out on this stage of the competition in recent seasons  Not since   when Lalit Modi  the brain behind the league  was given his suspension letter within minutes of the final ending at the DY Patil Stadium on the outskirts of Mumbai  has the competition seen such stampede for play off spots Back then  four teams finished on seven wins each  behind Mumbai  and the now defunct Deccan Chargers  eight Rajasthan  who finished seventh  would have finished second if they hadn limped to the finish with three straight losses  This time  as many as  of the  group games went to what Sir Alex Ferguson liked to call  squeaky bum time As much as level playing field  it also spoke of the World Cup fatigue that has clearly affected those whose teams went deep into that competition The unfavourable weather conditions have taken greater toll on the bowlers  Of the five leading wicket takers  only Mitchell Starc played for team that reached the last four of the World Cup  Dwayne Bravo  who tops the list with  wickets  and Yuzvendra Chahal  the leggie who has been pivotal to Bangalore campaign  didn even make the squads  Mitchell McClenaghan  whose bustling left arm pace has been at the heart of the Mumbai revival  has used this opportunity to work off the frustration of riding the pine during the showpiece event on home soil As ever  the IPL has unveiled clutch of promising Indian players  None has made greater impression than the Mumbai born Shreyas Iyer  whose   runs were one of the saving graces of another desperately disappointing Delhi Daredevils season  Unlike some of the earlier IPL success stories  who exited the stage as quickly as they entered remember Rajasthan Swapnil Asnodkar and Kings XI Punjab Paul Valthaty  Iyer has already shown through his Ranji Trophy displays that he can tailor his game to suit the format Mumbai  who didn pick him  can point to the hard hitting Hardik Pandya  whose father took him and his brother to Kiran More academy in Baroda when he was just five years old  And when not posing for pictures with Mr Instagram  Chris Gayle  Sarfaraz Khan  another Mumbai talent but playing in Bangalore colours  has shown that he can muscle the ball long way Given the play off scenario  the smart money would be on Mumbai or Chennai  but look no further than Bangalore for the flutter  Virat Kohli  AB de Villiers and Gayle are third  fourth and seventh in the run making charts  It hard to think of more

Extreme athlete Dean Potter hailed as  visionary  by fellow climbers and friends,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/18/extreme-athlete-dean-potter-visionary-tributes,sport,Dean Potter was an artist and visionary  friends and contemporaries said on Monday  following the death of the extreme climber in Base jumping accident in Yosemite national park Potter died alongside fellow climber Graham Hunt on Saturday  when the pair leapt from    ft peak while wearing wingsuits  and crashed into cliff face Their bodies were recovered on Sunday  Neither was found to have deployed parachute Potter  who grew up in New Hampshire and lived more recently in Yosemite  was one of the most recognizable figures in extreme sports  and was the creator of  freebase a hybrid extreme sport that combined rock climbing without ropes and skydiving Graham Hunt  was also climber and Yosemite resident They crashed late on Saturday after leaping from promontory called Taft Point   ft above the valley floor  An investigation into what caused the men to crash is ongoing  Base jumping in Yosemite is illegal British climber Andy Kirkpatrick  who knew Potter off and on for more than decade  said that he was full of contradictions and thought of himself as an artist He was using his body and his life as some kind of twisted piece of art  really Kirkpatrick said  He was definitely walking quite hard path in his life  hustling and trying to make living while at the same time trying to live sort of zen life  and doing some of the most extreme versions of any sport  Base jumping and proximity flying and free soloing  Potter was sponsored by high profile brands and had an active presence on social media and in climbing films  but his extrovert qualities were countered by another life  like monk living in the woods  as quite shy person Kirkpatrick said  He and others described Potter as intense  alternately joyous  stoic  brooding and generous Potter death shocked the climbing community but not really shocked it Kirkpatrick said  because the inherent dangers in taking part in such extreme climbing for so many years made some kind of accident inevitable  But it sad  He leaves lot of people behind Kirkpatrick said and this robs even more people of the chance for him to inspire them in person  Potter climbed without any harnesses or protective gear  free soloing walked along slack rope across points of high elevation  highlining parachuted off cliffs  Base jumping often with webbed wingsuit to better control his flight  and flew in wingsuit near the surface of cliffs  mountains and ridges  proximity flying Base stands for building  antenna  span  earth Chris McNamara  climber who no longer Base jumps  told the Associated Press He always recognized how dangerous the sport was and at the same time how magical it was the tension between those two things  Alex Honnold  Yosemite resident and another of the world most renowned rock climbers  tweeted that Potter death had left him  in dark cloud and told the New York Times that Potter  shaped the direction of climbing for this generation  He was very creative influence on climbing  Conrad Anker posted on social media an old photo of Potter showing the moment before the pair jumped from plane to parachute into canyon  writing We loved it mostly because it was thrill and   of us knew we would never do anything quite this wild  Dean was visionary in many disciplines Anker wrote We will cherish these memories and hold the ray of life you often radiated close to our hearts  Potter courted controversy throughout his career  both in his increasingly dangerous maneuvers and his ways of drawing attention  In  he lost sponsorship from clothing company Patagonia after climbing Utah Delicate Arch  in  he and Honnold lost Clif Bar sponsorships after they appeared in documentary about Yosemite climbing that the company felt included overly dangerous climbs and falls He also drew criticism for strapping Whisper  his miniature Australian cattle dog  into backpack to soar with him on wingsuited Base jumps  The film When Dogs Fly depicts Whisper many flights Yosemite chief of staff Mike Gauthier  who occasionally climbed with Potter  downplayed concerns over his methods in conversation with National Geographic He was larger than life character Gauthier said He just in the pantheon of great athletes that people idolize and look up to  Asked about the fact that Base jumping is illegal in national parks  Gauthier said We re not too concerned about discussing the ins and outs of Base jumping He and park ranger Scott Gediman instead emphasized the losses of those who survive Potter and Hunt  with the latter saying This is huge loss for all of us  Potter lived with his girlfriend  Jen Rapp  and her three children in Yosemite  Rapp told the Times that Yosemite  is exactly where he want his rule breaking  fringe pushing  counterculture spirit to live forever  In    documentary for Outside Television he described recurring dream of flying and falling When was little boy my first memory was flying dream Potter said And in my dream flew and also fell  always wondered as got older if it was some premonition of me falling to my death   So started free soloing harder and harder routes  kind of proving to myself that could take control of this pretty much the biggest fear that had  of falling to my death  He said that adding parachutes gave him an extra security that balanced the dangers of free solo climbing It ups my chances of living to be an old man Potter said And then you have the super bonus of if you fall  you don die  you fly

Alex Hales is Twenty maverick who England should embrace,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/18/alex-hales-twenty-20-maverick-test-england,sport,English cricket is nothing if not cussedly predictable  For all the restlessness of the past few years there are still few things more likely to induce funk of self destructive confusion than the sight of uncooperative  unorthodox  unarguable talent  At which point enter Alex Hales of the Mumbai Indians  who has this week flown out to play for them in the IPL on short term deal  despite clash with the start of the NatWest   Blast  And who is  age   already close to becoming an English cause ce le bre before he has even had the chance to explore his full potential as an international cricketer This is not to suggest Hales belongs in the established list of maverick English talent  He not Botham  Gower  Snow or Pietersen  In fact  he is in his own way more interesting  player who stands at one remove simply because of the way he plays  the nature of his talent as much as its extent Only in England could the style of man cricket the ability to hit ball with exhilarating venom outweighing his ability to block it out on difficult pitch become kind of macro political issue  But this is the way we seem to be heading  with Hales as kind of Princess Diana for the Twenty generation  not to mention providing all the evidence you need in one under explored international cricketer of the basic stodginess that threatens to stifle not just the England team success but its connection with broader  younger public One thing is clear Mumbai have cherry picked English cricket most exhilaratingly pure striker of ball  not to mention its most modern  state of the art  new world ish talent  Jos Buttler has case  too  on this front  although England are currently doing their best to sweep him under the carpet by batting him down at No But Hales has the runs  the ICC ranking and the IPL bench spot And yet  for all that  he also has just  ODIs to his name  no central contract or prospect thereof  no immediate hope of playing Test cricket  and is of most interest currently as an example of how not to cultivate an outsize but unorthodox talent  Certainly letting him fly across the world to warm the bench in cricket glitziest domestic competition is not the worst thing English cricket has done to Hales this season  that would be flying him around the world to play only one live match at England meekest  most abject World Cup to date With this in mind there is an element of just deserts for anybody concerned with Hales absence from the ECB relaunched   competition albeit for just single match is in some way show of disloyalty  Frankly who could blame him It has been my aim and goal to get into this tournament  When found out for sure that would be part of it  it was just elation for me Hales said on Monday  Contrast this with the sheer sense of all consuming blue Lycra gloom around England tearfully borne World Cup campaign  Or indeed with the weary disappointment in Hales own reaction to England then coach Peter Moores musing publicly on his being  found out  by international bowlers able to duck the ball into to him  got bowled once by Bhuvneshwar Kumar with an in swinger  That not being worked out  that a good delivery Hales pointed out  rightly miffed  More striking is the urge to dismiss talented player so easily  This is enough to make you weep little in itself  with the suggestion that even at the highest level  cricket in England is still as it was in the    sport where weakness trumps strengths every time  where selection must be based above all on even handed blanket competence  and where concentrating on what player can do is more important than glorying in what he can In this sense the real point here is not about Hales at all  but about the ability to promote and nurture the most talented in what is  like it or not  glorious public entertainment rather than self nourishing corporate bubble  Hales may or may not be good enough to flourish more broadly  But as ever  player other selectors and coaches might have treated like new toy  to be cherished and allowed to fly  will instead have to ferret at the fringes  to doubt his methods  and to knock twice as loud as more orderly talent just to make it to the same place This despite the fact England only successful modern short form team  the  World Twenty  champions  were notable for their startling boldness  with openers who simply attacked without fear of censure  policy that has not been seen since Not to mention the fact Hales himself has achieved enough in cut and shut international career to deserve little faith  His unbeaten hundred against Sri Lanka last year is up there with the best international Twenty innings ever played  He has     international runs at an average of  in the past year  In first class cricket he has scored   runs at  with five hundreds over the last two years batting No  for Nottinghamshire  Hales would make thrillingly potent Test No There is no template for how an international cricketer should emerge these days  Hales is neither David Warner  authentic child of Twenty  nor Kane Willamson  whose orthodox success opened the portals of the Twenty circuit  He is simply curiously unexplored talent who faces vital year or two  Some success next season in the IPL  he probably won play this time round  Mumbai have only just settled on an opening pair  could yet kickstart his career in another direction  Alternatively  new England regime might feel emboldened to trust in an uneven but undeniably exhilarating batsman Either way we will probably never know how good he might have been  Hales has  to an extent  already been decisively mucked about and under nurtured  challenged to justify his sense of adventure when he might have been encouraged simply to go with it What is certain is there will be others  that the future  even in England  is roughly Hales shaped  And that English cricket would be happier place all round with the knowledge that talent  however ragged edged  will find home

recent talk of  hating being the winner of the Tour de France  hating cycling  hating the media for asking me questions about Lance Armstrong and hating Lance Armstrong for giving Oprah that interview  may have been delivered in spirit of refreshing honesty but  when it recast as headline  it can make him sound surly and ungrateful  Thankfully  Wiggins  personality is given room to breathe in this  minute Desert Island Discs episode  and he is an absolute joy The programme has habit of throwing up personal and original interviews that would be missed by specialist journalists try Jack Dee  Nick Clegg  Tony Adams or Daniel Kahneman for starters and lot of the credit for that has to go to Kirsty Young  whose lack of sporting expertise benefits her hugely when speaking to Wiggins  Most people don care for the particulars of cycling  they want to know where Wiggins found his talent and drive  why he has dedicated so much of his time to his craft  how his career has affected the rest of his

mulling over England relationship with the sport  At the minute  that bond is weathering an ebb rather than enjoying the flow but  as Jon argues  the connection between cricket and the green land on which it was first played is ingrained deeply I can offer only anecdotal evidence of its health  but have played hundreds of matches against thousands of people since was  years old  and apart from the natural passing of time  it feels the same as it ever did  Amateur captains are still filling teams at the last minute  one of my team mates  who skippers his own occasional side  is not averse to approaching strangers in supermarkets few hours before the game if he desperate enough  and sometimes it works too  but even on lazy Sundays we face many hard hitting young batter and hot headed

to grant Turton FC promotion to their Premier Division  Turton finished second in Division One  which would be enough to earn their promotion  but their ground is not fit for the higher league and any new building work had to be complete by  March to make them eligible for promotion The club chairman  Peter Gray  insists they have the funds to do the work but could not have carried it out during the season as it would have led to games being called off  The club and league are currently involved in standoff  but the tide of public opinion seems to be swaying with the Turton  petition set up to give the club the  promotion they deserve  has over   signatures  Here their case Turton FC won promotion by finishing second in Division One of West Lancs League  The League committee have decided not to allow them promotion and not relegated anyone as they say the ground improvements should have been done by st March  The club have secured   of funding and all improvements that will achieve step criteria will be done before the start of the season  The club feel that the hard work and success achieved is being ignored and bit of flexibility and support from the league was all that was needed If you haven read Roy Keane latest autobiography or Matt Dickinson book about Bobby Moore  fret not  Seamus Mahony of the Dublin Review of Books is here to explain what you missed  Mahony provides wonderful  scything summary of Keane book in the first section of this essay  He spends   words describing Keane book  cutting down its author with winning sarcasm throughout  The approach works perfectly  those of us who bothered to read the book should have waited for Mahony review  which cuts out the context we knew already and distills the writing to the four things Keane does best  contradictions  put downs  humour and anger When it comes to Moore  Mahony does not roll out the red carpet of forgiveness that usually buttresses the sporting heroes of yesteryear  Instead  he tells rather sad story about man who was more bland than most of us would like to admit  The inscription on the giant statue of Moore that stands outside Wembey reads  Immaculate footballer  Imperial defender  Immortal hero of   First Englishman to raise the World Cup aloft  Favourite son of London East End  Finest legend of West Ham United  National Treasure  Master of Wembley  Lord of the game  Captain extraordinary  Gentleman of all time But  when all the patriotic bluster is stripped away  Moore was really quiet  unconfrontational and detached man who finished his career playing in the Danish Third Division  squandered lot of his money in failed businesses and ended up offering anodyne punditry on the radio The game was only good to him for so long and the same may yet be said for Keane  who admitted in his book that nothing he will ever do again come close to the experiences he enjoyed as younger man  Keane and Moore are proper football men  but their books have not inspired in Mahony great deal of confidence in the sport Children are constantly told that playing competitive sports builds character and teaches valuable life lesions  wonder  Many great athletes are one trick ponies  or hedgehogs  to use Isaiah Berlin classification and the character traits that made them successful in professional sport are often handicap in retirement  Bobby Moore calmness and air of detachment served him well at Wembley in   but during the wet Sunday afternoons of the rest of his life this reserve gave an impression of Chauncey Gardner like emptiness  Roy Keane anger was  as he freely admits   useful tool  during his years as midfield enforcer  but it often backfired on him during his managerial career Writer  illustrator  cartoonist  artist  acoustic guitar dabbler and

The Clippers are still the Clippers  and hope made the pain of defeat worse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/18/the-clippers-are-still-the-clippers-and-hope-made-the-pain-of-defeat-worse,sport,In retrospect  maybe it would have hurt less had Chris Paul missed that shot When the Los Angeles Clippers point guard  practically playing on one leg  hit the basket that beat the San Antonio Spurs  At the time  some called Paul Game game winner  which eliminated the defending champions in the first round of the playoffs  the single greatest moment in Clippers history  It was sign that running joke of franchise was finally moving on from the darkness of the Donald Sterling days into the the bright lights of the Steve Ballmer era In the aftermath of the Clippers  dramatic collapse in their semi finals  Paul shot looks more like the setup to painful practical joke  Thursday night  the Clippers were on the threshold of making it to the Western Conference Finals for the first time in team history  The Clippers were up   over the Houston Rockets in the series and had built  point lead late in the third quarter  There was nervous expectation in the air  as if Staples Center was on the cusp of joyous eruption  the kind usually reserved for Lakers fans In an alternate universe  Game would have been remembered for Blake Griffin spectacular   spin and layup  it the kind of highlight reel play that provides the perfect exclamation mark on cathartic victory  Unfortunately it will be remembered now mostly as the moment that Griffin emptied out his arsenal  It wasn the end of the game  it was the third quarter and after unleashing the move Griffin failed to score again that night When Griffin went cold  the Rockets heated up  going on   run in the fourth quarter  With James Harden  their best player  mostly on the bench  Houston stunned LA by turning what should have been blow out loss into double digit victory Normally when describing dramatic collapses  one includes disclaimer saying that the losing team failures shouldn take anything away from what the winning team managed to do  When it comes to Game  the Clippers  failures should take nearly everything away from what the Rockets accomplished  Houston won this game in the same way someone  wins  fight against an opponent who knocks themselves out while tripping over their own shoelaces Houston comeback wasn the result of any clever strategy on the part of head coach Kevin McHale beyond vague  Hey  this guy is scoring somehow  might as well keep him in It difficult to imagine that the team planned ahead of time to sit MVP candidate James Harden  with the playoffs on the line  so that Josh Smith  cut mid contract by the woeful Detroit Pistons earlier in the season  could launch the types of three pointers he had been reliably bricking ever since he left Atlanta The Rockets ended up winning by the comfortable margin of    There would be Game and it would be in Houston Game was one of those shocking losses that teams rarely come back from  so the Clippers    loss to the Rockets on Sunday felt almost predetermined  It barely even felt like game  more like an epilogue to Game s bewildering climax  The Rockets  just the ninth team to overcome   series deficit in the NBA Playoffs  advanced to the Conference Finals for the first time since  Following the loss  Magic Johnson  Los Angeles Lakers legend and indirect catalyst of Sterling overdue NBA exile  probably echoed the thoughts of many about the other LA based team  by tweeting that  the Clippers are still the Clippers  I thought the Spurs taught the Clippers how to win after tough game series  was wrong  The Clippers are still the Clippers It not statement that needs much unpacking  Since relocating to LA in   the Clippers and their fans have suffered through countless losing seasons  disappointments during their team very rare postseason appearances and inevitably ugly off the field controversies This has led to talk of there being Clippers curse  which is ridiculous  There no reason to bring the supernatural into the equation to explain your team suffering  not when the team owned by racist slumlord who had history of dreadful decision making and even worse people skills  The Clippers weren cursed any more than Night Shyamalan has  bad luck  when it comes to making movies  When the person nominally in charge is terrible at what they do  likely successes become regrettable failures Of course  for the first time since the team moved to LA  there is no Sterling to blame for the Clippers  misfortune  with the exception of his estranged wife Shelly  who still skulks about Staples Center in the official capacity as the team No  fan  There probably someone creating new curse out there right now  certainly team that employs Matt Barnes has at least some amount of bad karma due  but the more boring explanation may lie in that first round victory over the Spurs Paul  their most important player  missed the first two games against the Rockets thanks to the hamstring injury he suffered at the end of that draining seven game series  The Clippers managed to split those two games in Houston  but the effort put an additional burden on Griffin  who at times was visibly exhausted  It didn help that DeAndre Jordan found himself in foul trouble while the Clippers  bench was almost as bad as advertised  even factoring in Austin Rivers unexpected takeover in Game  There are reasonable explanations to be had here Not that any of these theories will make the Clippers collapse easier for diehard fans to accept  In their first season under new ownership  the Clippers had chance to go deeper into the playoffs than they ever had before  They were minutes away from the culmination of an extended basketball exorcism that began with Sterling sale of the Clippers  Paul near miraculous game winner against the Spurs was sign  it had to be There was hope  That what made this collapse so painful for Clippers fans  there nothing that makes failure hurt quite so much as the promise of success  especially after you ve gone so long without it 
Billy Vunipola  m team man now  for Saracens and England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/18/billy-vunipola-england-rugby-world-cup-saracens,sport, It been good season but an eventful one Billy Vunipola says as he rubs meaty hand across his brow and smiles as the memories tumble through him  After the desolation of last season ending  when he and Saracens lost the old Heineken Cup and the Premiership finals in successive weeks  Vunipola has been through more varied emotions this campaign He was replaced as England No  in the autumn  amid accusations of arrogance from those who mean most to him  and watched Ben Morgan play outstandingly in his place  Vunipola then benefited from twist of fate as Morgan broke his leg in January The Tongan born powerhouse returned as one of England best players in the Six Nations  His name is now inked in as key man in the World Cup squad to be announced on Wednesday There has been more turbulence and hope with Saracens  Last month Vunipola was allowed to play in the semi finals of the Champions Cup only few days after being cleared of head butting Mathew Tait of Leicester  He then lost another heartbreaker in Europe  when he was Saracens  star performer in narrow defeat at Clermont Auvergne Saracens have also wavered in the Premiership  They were outside the top four play off places going into the final weekend of the regular season but an early Vunipola try on Saturday set up the predictably easy victory over London Welsh that assured their semi final place  This Saturday they meet Northampton  who robbed them of the title right at the end of extra time year ago  in showdown to decide who makes the final again  was quite low on motivation after those two finals last year Vunipola admits It was hard to lift myself up  We then had everything that went on with England in November  But was glad could come back and show that  once got the opportunity again  could do good job  So that all ve been trying to focus on this year trying to help my team  Of course Vunipola has been through much more complex emotions and he opens up when asked if his troubles started because he had become lost in small bubble of fame as an England international Definitely he says And when things start to go wrong you question everything  It spirals out of control when you should just try to relax  But you start thinking just negative thoughts and you question yourself as player and as person  m glad ve learnt from that and got stronger  It was one of the hardest moments of my life but it was probably the big push needed from Stuart Lancaster and my family  Them telling me not to be lazy helped lot  Vunipola mother  in particular  pointed out he had become arrogant as well as lazy She is minister in the Methodist church in High Wycombe Vunipola explains Her job is to keep us humble  same as my father does  but she has that faith to calm us down and tell us what we don want to hear  She said there a passage in the Bible which says the arrogant will be humbled and the humble will be picked up  She definitely felt was being arrogant  But it hard when you re playing well to realise you are being arrogant  m thankful she did it  It was tough to take because it not what you want to hear about yourself but needed her to say it  She said it in few different ways at first and  when she read that passage from the Bible  realised it coming from good place  changed my ways from then on  stopped stressing because when your mind is cluttered it no good  You have to play with clear mind  Amid the clutter of last autumn had Lancaster given any hints that he might be dropped  Vunipola scrunches up his face Yeah  there were signs  got an injury to my eye in the South Africa game  sprinted off to get it stitched up and then to have the coach say you re not needed is hard  was gutted at the time  It gave me an inkling into what would happen the following week when they were starting doing lineout drills without me  They were telling me Don read anything into it but  Vunipola laughs  that quite awkward  You ve only got two days to learn the lineouts so you re going to do it with the guys who are starting  Vunipola disappointment was accentuated by the rampaging way in which Morgan played in his place Yeah  you want to be starting but took it for granted  thinking was ahead of him  Ben played well and he was unlucky to get injured  We don swap texts too often but he sent me few nice messages before came back for the Welsh game and afterwards as well  did the same in the autumn when got dropped  That shows our respect for each other  Morgan will be in the World Cup squad but he has not played any rugby since his injury  Vunipola  clearly  is ahead of him in the race to start at No  but the situation would be made intriguing if Steffon Armitage were added to Lancaster squad  Yet it seems likely that Armitage  European Player of the Year last season while again helping Toulon win the Champions Cup this month  will be excluded because he plays club rugby in France It has become contentious issue because it is hard to believe England would not be improved significantly by the powerful presence of Armitage an openside flanker or  occasionally  No Vunipola answers in detail when ask him for his personal view on Armitage eligibility for selection  It definitely tough one  There are loads of arguments on both sides  But for me if you want to play for England that badly and you feel you deserve the opportunity  then why not stay here  m sure any of the  clubs in the Premiership would take him on  Look at me and my brother  Mako  the prop who will also be in the World Cup squad We ve just signed new contracts to play for Saracens but also for England  That was huge driving force in our decision to stay  m sure it would add great competition if he were to be added but it would cause lot of stir within the squad  would welcome competition but  on the other side  it would derail few of the boys and the faith we have staying in England  They would start to waver and more would go  So think Lancaster will keep the same squad  Chris Robshaw is playing unbelievably well at and he our captain and don think the coach wants to disrupt the squad so close to the World Cup  But if he comes in  it could help make me better player  Vunipola has played often enough against Armitage and Toulon  Does the exiled loose forward look exceptional to him I think he a very good player in very  very good team  Personally think he world class but do you want to disrupt the squad you ve got now  His own attention is fixed on this weekend  Last season controversial defeat by Northampton  his opponents again  hurt him  Saracens lost    conceding heavily scrutinised try seven minutes into injury time  So many bodies were in the way that the match official had to watch the replay repeatedly before  without any definitive clarity  giving the decision to Northampton  The same official also disallowed Saracens try after he decided  belatedly  that Vunipola was guilty of obstruction  It definitely took long time to get over it Vunipola says There has also been quite bit of recent history with Northampton  Before joined Saracens they had struck up quite difficult relationship with Northampton after Sarries won there few times  Northampton said we disrespected them  We sang song with the door open after we beat them at their place and they heard it and it sparked everything  It was before came in and maybe we were naive  But they ve not forgotten it  In terms of competition we know how good they are  So we would not disrespect them  But we have had good few battles and they have come up trumps the last few games  They beat us both times in the league but we can go there and dream of winning at Franklin Gardens in the semis  It definitely possible  Anything seems possible against the backdrop of Vunipola own past  He arrived in England from Tonga on an icy January morning in   Six year old Billy and his mother  brother and two sisters were met by his father  who was playing hooker for Pontypool I remember we came into Heathrow  My dad drove us back to Pontypool  It was freezing cold and don think we had beds  We just slept on the floor covered by blankets  There was frost on the windows and we had never seen anything like it  When you breathe you can see the cold air and that was something we found fun to start with  Vunipola adjusted to his new life and   years later  he was such forceful rugby player he was offered scholarship to Harrow  He laughs now at surreal if testing experience It was definitely strange one  It was scary  didn know anyone  was going in the sixth form and everyone had their friends  was boarding  too  for the first time but it wasn so bad after while  Everyone was interested in me and made friends quite quickly  It was quite an eye opener  actually  This is one of the best schools in England and the facilities were crazy good  But it was weird too  On Sunday you were meant to wear tops and tails  ve never admitted this to my mum but never went to church on Sunday because never wanted to wear my tails and they cost her lot of money  Sorry  Mum  The muscled  year old chuckles guiltily  We are sitting in narrow passageway outside BT Sport television studio  where Vunipola will soon appear on Rugby Tonight  and keep being told to quieten down by technician behind black curtain  There is time for one last question about Vunipola mood with the World Cup starting in exactly four months  do feel the tingle Vunipola says  lowering his voice dramatically but am held back because might get injured or something might happen  m scared of thinking too far ahead but there is tingle because England can do something special  We have to get out of the group but  if we do  we ll be battle hardened and it will give us the confidence to know we can beat anyone on the day  But ve learnt this year not to get ahead of myself  It one step at time for me now  Watch both Aviva Premiership semi finals on  May  and the final at Twickenham on  May  exclusively live on BT

County cricket  the week final over,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/99-94-cricket-blog/2015/may/18/county-cricket-final-over-sussex-durham-notts-t20-blast,sport,First faced second at Hove  as Middlesex consolidated top spot in low scoring match against Sussex  There are  of course  many ways to win and many ways to lose cricket match  but an unlikely one suggested itself in this crucial

Bizarrely  Middlesex first innings extras was the  top score  in the match  beating Michael Yardy  by  clear runs  Though the fielding side culpability for leg byes is sometimes minimal  that quantity

Baseball own Deflategate happened years ago and was much better,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/18/baseballs-own-deflategate-happened-years-ago-and-was-much-better,sport,Baseball is almost quarter of the way into its regular season while the NFL is the dead middle of its offseason  yet football still dominates the headlines  The quarterback of the New England Patriots playing role in the under inflation of footballs more than three months ago is getting more coverage right now than anything Bryce Harper  Rod  the competitive Cubs or the unstoppable Houston Astros have done all season It can be disheartening for  America pastime  to always be in the shadow of football  America one true religion  but this latest instance is less about which sport is more popular than it is story of baseball failing to market its strengths again  Because if the country is enthralled by ball tampering  as it peculiarly seems to be  baseball boasts the greatest to ever do it  Hall of Fame pitcher Gaylord Perry Tom Brady and the Patriots continue to deny they did anything wrong  Gaylord Perry not only admitted to throwing spitball during his  season career  he wrote trolling book before  trolling  was even term titled Me The Splitter  The Candid Confessions of Baseball Greatest Spitball Artist  Or How Got Away with It  in   smack in the middle of his prime Brady has been suspended for four games and is rumored to be assembling high priced legal team to sue the NFL  Perry didn even get ejected from game for cheating until near the end of his st season in the majors  nine years after writing book about his cheating ways The NFL is changing how game balls will be handled before games  Before the  season baseball banned pitchers from going to their mouths even if they then wiped off their hand  Perry and other spitballers adapted by hiding foreign substances on their person  After Perry book came out in   baseball allowed umpires to rule any pitch that moved suspiciously to be  spitball The first instance was ruled ball  the second resulted in an ejection  An ejection without any evidence blows The Wells Report strong circumstantial evidence out of the water During Perry career  both an ump and an opposing manager ran up and snatched his hat off his head during games  hoping to find all manner of illegal substances fall out  Can you imagine the reaction if something similar happened to Tom Brady during game  If Ed Hochuli or Rex Ryan tore Brady helmet from his head  pantsed him or plowed into huddle to look for deflation needle  National news networks would break into regular programming Everything the NFL is doing now  baseball did before and better  Let tell Gaylord Perry story to new generation  Let encourage today pitchers to re embrace the spitball  Baseball can slip past the NFL in the ball tampering news  We just need to lube it up with some Vaseline It hard Haf r Ju li us Bjo rnsson  the Icelandic actor who plays The Mountain on  Game of Thrones on hitting baseball Bjo rnsson spent some time in the cage with the Phillies this week and it didn go particularly well  He didn hit one over the fence  which is unfortunate because Bjo rnsson looks very much like  Mark McGwire and likely could crush baseballs like eyeballs if he was taught the game and the Mountain is far from the only GOT character with baseball potential Jon Snow as the handsome leader of the frozen North is essentially Joe Mauer  Jaime Lannister is part of successful  self important family and has no arm  Matt Holliday plays for the St Louis Cardinals and can throw  Tyrion Lannister is every scrappy  undersized middle infielder with intangibles  And we all know that Daenerys Targaryen dragons are eventually going to come in as closers and spit fire  Throw in the fact that George RR Martin and Bill James look like brothers and Game of Thrones is baseball best marketing vehicle in years October is coming   Miguel Cabrera hit the  th home run of his career on Saturday night  pushing him past Andres Galarraga for the most all time by player from Venezuela  Barring injury  Cabrera will also pass Galaragga for career hits and RBI this year  Ozzie Guillen record for most profanities uttered by Venezuelan player  however  will never be broken Shin Soo Choo  OF  Rangers  for   HR  RBIDenard Span  OF  Nationals  for   HR  RBI  SBErick Aybar  SS  Angels  for   RBIChris Owings B  Diamondbacks  for Matt Barnes   Red Sox   innings  strikeouts  wins   ERAJohn Danks   White Sox  innings   strikeouts  win   ERACC Sabathia   Yankees  innings   strikeouts  wins   ERA DJGalloEtc in an effort to make the game less boring  do you think the players should rotate positions each inning like in volleyball First off  we in the baseball fan community don refer to the sport as  boring The correct term is  classically slow Second  this is the greatest idea ever Imagine Cardinals first baseman Matt Adams having to play an inning at shortstop and another in centerfield  Or Diamondbacks catcher Gerald Laird having to play any position other than one in which he just crouches in stationary position  National League fans like to talk about the extra strategy involved with having pitchers hit  rotating positions would be strategy extravaganza  Swing away or drop bunt after bunt down the third base line in the direction of Delmon Young  And when do you put your players in their ideal positions  Do you want Matt Adams at first in the ninth inning  The ninth inning might be irrelevant if he fails to get to  ground balls hit three feet to his left or right in an earlier inning Baseball has been fixed and it all thanks to volleyball Now we just have to make volleyball less boring  Maybe give the players baseball bats Alright  Phillies  Gather around and take knee  OK  Now listen up  What are you guys doing out there  Five wins in row  This is unacceptable  One or two here and there is okay  It not preferred  but mistakes can happen  But five  Five in row  Under no circumstances is that okay Last Tuesday you had the worst record in baseball  Now  You re   games out of wildcard spot  You ve given people hope  Hope  You know what hope does  Yes  Cole  Hope that you ll be traded gets you out of bed every day  But that not what m referring to here  Please don interrupt me again  OK  where was  Oh  right  Hope  Hope is bad  okay  Hope keeps Ruben Amaro employed  If this team takes positive turn  it only negative for the franchise  You guys needed to bottom out this year  You need to go for   losses    You needed to make it  clear to ownership that Amaro has ruined this franchise and had to be fired  If you keep up this winning  you ll stay in striking distance of wildcard spot  Then Cole won get traded  OK  no need to cry  Cole  And not only will Cole not get traded  but Amaro will deal the one or two decent prospects you have in the minors for some veteran pieces at the deadline in futile attempt to win it all  So this winning stops now  OK  Not tomorrow  Not next week  Now  These five wins better be the longest win streak you have this year or your entire season will be disaster  Now get out of here and play terribly  And someone get Cole tissue The Cubs have won six of seven  Jon Lester has been one of the best pitchers in baseball this month and Kris Bryant has decided it time to start hitting home runs in the majors  with four in his last eight games  The Cubs are even getting breaks  not something regularly associated with team that have title droughts of more than   years baseball is hard  poor Gregory Polanco  http t co qqBmOus FBThe Chicago Cubs are good team  Yet if they win the World Series  most people will still react like Gregory Polanco on that pop up Rodriguez continues to crush the ball with three more home runs this week to give him  on the season  He now just five RBI short of tying Barry Bonds for fourth all time and only  hits away from    If Rod keeps up his current pace  he ll reach   hits on June rd  home game  So the Yankees are going to have to figure out how to not acknowledge one of their own players reaching   hits at Yankee Stadium  You have five weeks  Yankees  Five weeks to prepare for the most awkward silence ever  Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria has fired manager Mike Redmond after   start  The standard cliche is that you fire the coach because you can fire the players  Cliches are lazy and  in this case  far from accurate  When it comes to the Marlins  you fire the manager because you can fire the owner  The Marlins will likely make their usual calls for new manager  Jack McKeon or some random guy no one has ever heard of  but why not try new approach that could also boost the franchise traditionally horrible attendance  Have one lucky fan selected at random at every home game manage the team for the day  Or  better yet  just hand the job over to the Marlins Park outfield home run sculpture  It large  It hard to look at  It overpriced  It gets animated few times game and then reverts to just sitting there  It basically baseball manager already without the title  Tough break for Braves starter Shelby Miller to lose his perfect game in the bottom of the second inning on Sunday when he walked Marcell Ozuna of the Marlins  So close  That the kind of near miss that has to gnaw at pitcher forever  If American Pharaoh wins the Triple Crown  it will be interesting to see if stat heads claim Mike Trout still had better year  Prized Mets rookie Noah Syndergaard made the first home start of his career on Sunday and had this to say before the game It gonna be in front of the greatest fans in baseball  and in an unbelievable stadium  so m really looking forward to that So now you know wasn lying when said that Noah Syndergaard had never previously pitched at Citi Field  Exciting news  ve decided when it okay for players to break baseball unwritten code and celebrate and show emotion  When players dislike or players playing against my favorite team celebrate and yell and pump their fists and jump around  it classless  When everyone else does it  it fun and great for the game  Please update your unwritten rules to reflect this  baseball  Thanks  Hunter Pence is back from his broken arm and he looks as awkward as ever  was afraid that he heal in way that would make him throw  run and swing in traditional manner kind of like modern take on the movie Rookie of the Year  But nope  He still looks like he never played baseball before  What relief  I still annoyed that Cleveland manager Terry Francona took Corey Kluber out on Wednesday night after the eighth inning when he had  strikeouts and shutout going against the Cardinals  Kluber deserved chance to go for   Also  we all deserved chance to criticize Francona for riding his ace too long if Kluber fell apart in the ninth inning or got hurt  We were robbed of that opportunity  Louisiana Monroe and Louisiana Lafayette played Rock  Paper  Scissors during three hour rain delay on Friday night  Sure  it looks like good  clean fun  but has anyone asked who supplied the players with their imaginary rocks  papers and scissors  The Sun Belt Conference might have real imaginary boosters problem   Mad Men blew chance for memorable series finale  The Mets had popped up earlier in the series  Why not have the entire Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce clan decide to take in game at Shea  Laughs  smokes and drinks could be had  while the feeling of loss and hopelessness that pervaded the entire show run would still be there thanks to the Mets  And then in the final scene  Don could hook up with Mrs Met in an equipment room  only to have her giant fabric head go up in flames when she rolls into his cigarette  That is memorable finale  Sometimes think Hollywood doesn even understand what art is anymore 
British Olympic taekwondo champion loses out after computer glitch,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/18/british-olympic-taekwondo-champion-loses-out-after-computer-glitch,sport,The British Olympian Jade Jones has criticised computer glitch that appeared to cost her medal at the World Taekwondo Championships Jones  London  gold medal winner  was level with her Iranian opponent  Kimia Zernoorin  when the scoring system froze  during the quarter final in Russia Jones had dropped only two points in her road to the last eight  and was leading   against the  year old Iranian  who fought back to   In the final moments  the pair were level at   in the  kg contest  with Jones striking crucial blow to the chest of Zenorin  But the Iranian landed counter blow  and when the scoring system came back online  only she had been awarded point for the manoeuvre  not Jones The  year old Brit  unbeaten in her previous six tournaments  lost her match  and said she was distraught The scoring system crashed and when it returned  didn have the points  couldn understand why  still can   Jones said in statement on the GB Taekwondo website  It was really tight match but thought had it when scored the spinning back kick  She a tough opponent and fought well  know could have perhaps covered better but it so frustrating to see good shots not awarded points when there is so much at stake  Jones was hoping to take the title in Russia  which would have meant she automatically qualified for the Rio Olympics of   Her housemate  Liverpudlian Bianca Walkden  took the gold medal in the  kg category  Jade was very unlucky  and the system may have overloaded just as she struck Steve Flynn  operations director of GB Taekwondo  said It hard to know  but obviously we re frustrated  We re not able to appeal  because there no immediate record of what happened and it would involve trawling through huge amounts of data to try and recover any evidence  Jones is still well placed to qualify for Rio  with the European Games in Baku her next big challenge  Flynn said The technology was introduced on the back of another controversial decision involving British taekwondo star  when Sarah Stevenson was eliminated from the  Olympics in Beijing  despite landing two point head kick that should have secured her spot in the semi finals  Stevenson was eventually reinstated after an appeal The contests were previously determined by panel of judges but the World Taekwondo Federation has since introduced sensors fitted inside the contenders  body armour  The technology is improving and it getting more and more reliable but obviously now we want to make sure that officials learn from this  and work out how it happened Flynn said The stakes were high enough here  as it is  and obviously we need to assess what happened before they get any higher  
Gennady Golovkin now has golden opportunity to become one of the best,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/18/boxing-gennady-golovkin-willie-monroe-jr-floyd-mayweather-middleweight-wba-kevin-mitchell,sport,OK  m operating through an imperfect prism here a few snatches of video highlights and some trusted fight reports but one thing seems as clear on Monday morning as it did on Saturday night  Gennady Golovkin deserves to be rated at or near the top of boxing pound for pound list In putting away the outrageously muscled Willie Monroe Jr inside six rounds  he delivered the result and performance his backers expected of him    th straight stoppage win  securing his dominance at middleweight  whatever other claimants say What is more significant  though  is the Kazakh determination to fight twice more in    against anyone willing to step into the ring with him  from Miguel Cotto to Sau A lvarez  to Andre Ward to Floyd Mayweather Now couple of those bouts Ward and Mayweather almost certainly will not happen  Ward  who operates at higher weight  is yet to rehabilitate himself fully after health and legal entanglements  and Mayweather  the welterweight king  wouldn share ring with Triple if he were armed with nuclear bomb  Even at catchweight Monroe more famous for being the great nephew of the eponymous  Worm  Monroe  who beat an early career Marvin Hagler  than his boxing talent echoed what nearly every Golovkin opponent has said I was getting hit in the kidneys and the hips and couldn feel my legs  Golovkin hurts people even when he doesn mean to knock them out  Ask Matthew Macklin and Martin Murray  who will testify that Gennady setup shots  the ones that manoeuvre an opponent into the best hitting zone  are as solid as his full strength blows The man is freak  pure and simple He is also superb technical boxer and an entertainer  He says that  when he chose to stand and trade with Monroe in the fourth round and took few shots  it was for the benefit of the fans who paid to see fight and not one sided beating I believe him  because he good enough to pull that off  Technically he is head and shoulders above any middleweight in the world Golovkin determination to please fans who spend lot of money to watch him is admirable and throwback  He wants to knock guys out  It couldn be more simple I remember conversation had in coffee shop in Las Vegas years ago with the then editor of Boxing News  Claude Abrams  and Kevin Kelley  who famously warred with Naseem Hamed at Madison Square Garden  What asked Kelley do boxing fans want  your fancy Dan European boxing or fight A few American fans sitting nearby chorused as one Knock the guy out  Knock the guy out  End of conversation No fans are as bloodthirsty as the Americans  While we tend to appreciate the finer points of the art on this side of the Atlantic  there they love to see guy flat on his back with blood dribbling through his teeth Golovkin is  and not really convincing trash talker  But he seems to have steadily won over the Americans  especially on the west coast  to where he has moved his family He has window of maybe three or four years to establish himself as one of the very best fighters of this era I think he ll do it but m not sure who he ll do it against

Rugby union  talking points from the weekend action,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/18/rugby-talking-points,sport,While Exeter and Saracens had to look at what was happening elsewhere  Leicester knew that victory would take them to the play offs in third place  The Premiership method of separating teams level on points is based first on the number of matches won and the Tigers had an advantage of one over their rivals going into the final round  If they had all been level on victories  points difference would have been the next factor  and it was used to divide Sarries and the Chiefs  and the Tigers  courtesy of some heavy defeats earlier in the season  would have come fifth under it  finishing with difference of about   fewer than the other two  An alternative system would have been to turn it into mini league  counting only the matches involving the three sides  Leicester won two  double over Exeter drew one and lost one  the Chiefs won two  doubling Saracens  and lost two  Sarries had the one victory and draw  Leicester and Exeter would have had  points each and  with the number of victories the same  the Chiefs would have prevailed on points difference  reason for making games won the first deciding factor is to give winning precedence over the accumulation of bonus points  Leicester are more adept at the former than the latter which is why  in Saturday play off  they will back themselves  There are no bonus points on offer  the result is everything  Paul ReesExeter  Saracens and Leicester all finished on  points but  in the end  the Chiefs were the ones left snookered despite racking up seven tries against Sale  They scored  tries in the regular season compared with Leicester  and  of their eight defeats  seven were by seven points or fewer  Ultimately the killer stat was tries conceded  Tigers and Sarries boasted the two tightest defensive records in the league  If Exeter can turn even couple of those narrow defeats into victories next season they can expect to be strong top four contenders in  months  time  The Sharks have also enjoyed more than respectable campaign and  in the shape of Josh Beaumont  have genuine England squad prospect  The bad news is that the competition grows ever tighter and finishing above clubs such as Harlequins and Gloucester  as they did this season  is not destined to get any easier  Robert KitsonThere were two schools of thought about the play offs on view at the Rec on Saturday  Bath  already guaranteed home semi final in the Premiership  chose to go in at near full strength  Gloucester  whose route to the th and final Champions Cup place involves play offs against the best non qualified side in the Guinness Pro and then the seventh side in the French Top   put out squad with eight from their academy  The result wasn as one sided as it could have been but had Bath been slightly less end of term in their approach the winning margin would have been much more than  points  Not that the sell out Rec minded  They await something much more pragmatic against Leicester next Saturday  while Gloucester think about Sunday and Connacht  Mike AverisThe World Cup may be only four months away but it is rest time for England top players and judging by the after match comments of the Wasps captain  James Haskell  the break comes not moment too soon At times we were brilliant and at times we looked like we were already one foot on the beach he said after admitting he was  out on my feet  after late Irish try by Andy Short had drawn helter skelter contest  Haskell  who is set to be named in England World Cup training squad on Wednesday  is looking forward to break before preparations for the tournament start in earnest  He is in need of beach somewhere after playing  games in all competitions for Wasps this season alongside his England commitments It always very difficult when the end of season is round the corner  you ve played lot of rugby  Guys are out on their feet While Haskell takes break  his colleague Joe Launchbury may be asked to play later this month in the Barbarians England XV match in an effort to give him more match time after his return from neck injury  Haskell added Joe would like to keep going but for the rest of us  am in need of some downtime Rob WildmanWe thought they might have avoided the ignominy but the traditional last quarter collapse of London Welsh meant their points against for the season soared past the   mark and the previous record  held by West Hartlepool  The Exiles finish the season with   points conceded over  matches  seeing off the   shipped by the north east side in the   season  In those days there were  teams in the Premiership  so that tally was racked up over four more matches  It closes the coffin on Welsh second stint in the Premiership  And so bad has it been that the Premiership suits recently mooted an end to promotion and relegation without the idea being laughed out of town  Off the field  where the real problems have always lain  London Welsh were never ready for Premiership rugby  this time or last  The Kassam Stadium  in theory perfectly pleasant ground  echoed again on Saturday to the sound of couple of thousand away fans  If there one thing we ve learned from the London Welsh experience  it that those much maligned minimum standards criteria were not quite such ridiculous concept after all  Clubs such as Exeter and Worcester spent years gathering credible packages for the Premiership  London Welsh application to the inspectorate three years ago was last minute and on the hoof  The good news  though  is that there may yet be life at the Kassam  Wasps have now left the area and if London Welsh can attract any floating voters in the Thames Valley they could grow into an attractive proposition  It ll take few years  And those years need to be spent in the Championship  Michael AylwinAs is so often the case  Conor Shea post match comments rang true after Harlequins  th league defeat of listless campaign We draw line under the season The dazzle that made Quins such popular Premiership winners in  has faded  Nick Evans is looking jaded and some of their England internationals may pay the price when the World Cup training squad is announced on Wednesday  Reinforcements are on the way  however  Adam Jones and James Horwill will beef up tight five that has too often been bullied this season  while the prospect of Danny Care capitalising on the front foot ball afforded to him by Jamie Roberts is mouth watering and at his best there are few more lethal finishers than Tim Visser  Still  when Wednesday  man England squad is whittled down to   Care  Marland Yarde and Nick Easter may find Harlequins  eighth place finish costs them it is their lowest since   when Shea arrived with just handful of games to go and with Bloodgate still looming large  Which brings us on to the upwardly mobile Newcastle and Dean Richards  who celebrated first league win over his former side since his ignominious exit  and in some style  mention  too  for the Falcons wing Zach Kibirige  who came through the second half unscathed  months after breaking his leg and damaging ankle ligaments on his Premiership debut  having just starred for England Under s in the Six Nations  It would be somewhat fanciful to describe Kibirige as possible England bolter if not for his horrific injury but let not forget there is life after the World Cup and  following his successful return  he will now be counting down the days with glee  Gerard Meagher

Chelsea Ruben Loftus Cheek hopes for an encore after difficult audition,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/18/chelsea-ruben-loftus-cheek-audition-west-brom-premier-league,football,Jose  Mourinho said prior to this game that Chelsea youth team  despite winning the FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League  should look to Ruben Loftus Cheek as their biggest title of the season  The reason being that the midfielder  has come up through the ranks  made his debut in the Champions League in December  and last weekend against Liverpool made his first start in the Premier League Gary Neville said he was impressed with the physicality of Loftus Cheek in that   draw at Stamford Bridge  although he glossed over the fact that he was taken off after an hour as Liverpool began to get foothold in midfield But if Loftus Cheek team mates in the youth side should look to him  it is to be hoped Loftus Cheek is not looking to those who have gone before him  Names such as Ryan Bertrand and Josh McEachran spring to mind as two youth players who have promised much but were deemed not up to the required standard Bertrand is at Southampton  having made the move permanent in February  at least having played and won the Champions League in  while at Chelsea  McEachran  richly feted once upon time  but now on loan at Vitesse  is doomed  surely  never to be first team player under Mourinho  He and Bertrand have been barged to one side by older  more experienced and illustrious players bought in by the manager Yet Loftus Cheek now finds himself given chance  The scrutiny is intense and he knows he will not be given much time  Mourinho was talking before the match about the process of sending Chelsea players away  players are on loan at the moment but at least Loftus Cheek was not mentioned as one of those he has in mind to farm out next season His role here was on the right of Nemanja Matic  with licence to get forward more frequently than the Serb but he was needed to screen in front of John Terry and Gary Cahill for the first  minutes  as West Bromwich got on the front foot  Unfortunately for him the first part of the game appeared to pass him by  up to and including the moment Saido Berahino gave the hosts the lead  As the forward spun round to shoot from  yards  Loftus Cheekwas tracking back but too far away to put in challenge  Maybe he was unsure of his footing  After six minutes he had shaped to shoot  slipped  and the ball trundled harmlessly away  He was on his backside again shortly after the goal  going in with two feet on Berahino  It was desperate challenge  deserving of yellow card  It was the last time the referee Mike Jones showed any sympathy to Chelsea player To Loftus Cheek credit he stayed out of the fracas that saw Diego Costa bumping his way around the West Bromwich defence and which inadvertently led to Cesc Fa bregas   yards away  wanting to get involved as well  It was his chip on to Chris Brunt head that resulted in the Spain international red card Shorn of team mate  Loftus Cheek life became harder  as the channels through to the Chelsea penalty area opened up  He began to see more of the Albion midfield than he would have liked  With the prospect of being overwhelmed  he may then have realised what life would be like against Manchester City or Real Madrid next season  Neville had evoked that very idea when he said he thought Matic needed partner  other than Fa bregas  in the big games next season  Fa bregas will be suspended at the start of next season  which could be the silver lining for Loftus Cheek from this difficult game made harder by Berahino penalty and effectively finished by Brunt hammer shot inside the left hand post But Mourinho would not have given Loftus Cheek consecutive starts in the league if he had not seen something he liked and one first half dribble and jink through midfield gave glimpse of what he likes to do when given some space His short passing was tidy but smacked of someone inclined to look for the easy ball out  Meanwhile his team mates from the youth side watched on from the bench  Nathan Ake who came on for the final  minutes  and Isaiah Brown  who managed  minutes were presumably as delighted as their friend  but the goalkeeper Jamal Blackman will have to wait another day for his debut Yet having got this close to the first team  Loftus Cheek and his young team mates will no doubt be keeping nervous eye on Chelsea incomings from the transfer market this summer  After this performance  some of the senior players will too

Uefa set to relax financial fair play rules that led to Manchester City fine,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/18/uefa-relax-financial-fair-play-michel-platini,football,Five years after promising to usher in new era of prudence for European football the Uefa president  Michel Platini  is poised to relax its financial fair play regulations after conceding they risk impeding the game growth After Platini revealed the likely changes  Uefa general secretary  Gianni Infantino  hurried to clarify that the proposed new rules would  encourage more growth  more competition and market stimulation while strengthening the emphasis on controlling spending and safeguarding financial stability  In practice  that is likely to mean that club owners will be able to invest more of their own money over three  to five year period as long as they can demonstrate that revenues will grow over that time to allow them to eventually break even It follows concerns that the rules as they stand are likely to lock in the dominance of those sides with the biggest commercial  matchday and broadcasting revenues and remove the impetus for new owners outside that to buy into clubs The changes are likely to provoke mixed feelings at the Etihad Stadium and the Parc des Princes after Uefa last season hit Manchester City and Paris Saint Germain with potential fines of up to  each together with squad restrictions In   Platini argued that owners including Roman Abramovich at Chelsea and Massimo Moratti at Internazionale had pleaded with him to bring in new rules to force clubs to break even They do not want to fork out any more said Platini at the time  But while overall net losses across Europe have plummeted from   bn   bn  in  to   in   critics argue that the system has disproportionately benefited the established order and allows the likes of Manchester United  Real Madrid and Bayern Munich to get ever stronger while preventing new challengers from emerging  Under the existing rules  the amount of leeway allowed to each club over three year reporting period was due to reduce from  to zero If clubs failed to stay within those limits  they were at risk of range of penalties up to and including expulsion from European competition  The changes to the rules described by Uefa sources as shift from austerity to growth will be seen by many as tacit admission that they were too draconian and victory for club owners who have been lobbying for the ability to invest their own money in the first team as well as the infrastructure Uefa insiders were keen to stress that the rules were an  evolution rather than revolution  and would seek to balance sustainability with the need to grow the game and attract new investors  The world is two faced but we will say this openly  think we ll ease things  but it will be the executive committee who will decide if it is to be eased or something like that  and the outcome will be known by the end of June said Platini in an interview with French radio station RTL  think the regulations have been very good and it is the clubs who voted for FFP  But the French press say it is not right that Abramovich can buy many players and in France they cannot buy them  But if the Qataris had bought AC Milan the French would also say we should make financial fair play even tougher  As it is  the Italians wanted it eased  Uefa is facing at least  separate legal challenges over FFP  Jean Louis Dupont  the lawyer leading the cases  welcomed the potential changes Ironically  given the support of the then owners of the two Milan clubs for the introduction of FFP it is understood they have been among the most active in lobbying for the rules to be relaxed  It is understood that the European Clubs Association has been consulted over the changes but they still need to be put before the Uefa club licensing committee early next month and voted on by the executive committee on  and  June  Any changes could be introduced as early as next season In the wake of the introduction of Uefa rules in    the Premier League and the Football League also brought in their own cost control regulations Financial fair play has proved successful in achieving considerable improvement in the financial health of European football in short period of time said Infantino Regular review of the Uefa financial fair play regulations is vital in ensuring that they keep pace with the ever changing football environment and the new challenges that this often poses

Barcelona transform their season from trouble to possible treble,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/18/barcelona-la-liga-champions-sid-lowe,football,It started against Atle tico Madrid and it ended against Atle tico Madrid  the circle completed at the Caldero  Three hundred and  days after Atle tico went to Barcelona and won the league  Barcelona went to Atle tico and won it back again  Leo Messi superb goal sufficient to take the title  But maybe  May was not the date  after all  maybe  January was  The night the crisis was contained  collective catharsis that became the first day of the rest of their season  There was trouble then  there may be treble now  Barcelona have won the league and two of their three remaining games are finals  against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey and Juventus in the European Cup The night of Sunday  January was at the end of week that had begun with defeat at Anoeta  where Messi sat on the bench  The following day  he had missed the only training session of the year open to fans due to  gastroenteritis  just as  with unfortunate timing  an interview with Xavi Herna ndez was published in which he noted that  gastroenteritis  is the classic excuse given when something else is wrong  That same afternoon Andoni Zubizarreta  the sporting director  was sacked  Carles Puyol walked hours later  And most thought Luis Enrique would follow  One poll showed that   of fans wanted him the coach to do so His relationship with Messi under scrutiny  Luis Enrique admitted that his position had been weakened with Zubizarreta departure and he has taken every opportunity to praise his absent friend since  Je re my Mathieu would later reveal that there had indeed been clash between Messi and the coach on the training pitch  And although they were still ducking the issue then  although Luis Enrique avoided questions about ultimatums and claimed not to read the papers on doctors  advice  he knew the board had begun sounding out replacements  Pretty soon  even they might be replaced  in that same week  presidential elections were called To reduce the tension Josep Mari Bartomeu said That might have helped  winning would have helped more Victories are the only things that can calm this wave Luis Enrique said  That night  Barcelona faced Atle tico  league champions and team they had not beaten in six matches last season  Lose and they might lose everything  But they did not lose  they beat Atle tico on the pitch and everyone else off it  The match finished  in one night they had scored as many against Diego Simeone side as in the whole of the previous season  Messi  Neymar and Luis Sua rez got them  the first time the trio had all scored in the same game  but not the last  And after the match  Messi appeared again Stop throwing shit he said There was something different about Barcelona  aggressive  driven  hyperactive  their best performance of the season  Maybe they had won thanks to the crisis  not because of it  Confronted by their own collapse  handed an external enemy against whom they could cohere  point to prove  last chance perhaps  they had pulled back from the abyss  The crisis management had been effective  the question was whether it would be lasting  Luis Enrique was asked afterwards if he thought the crisis had gone No he said next time we lose it will be back  It wasn back because they did not lose  not often Everything changed Messi later admitted  Players may have still had their doubts  they may not have always appreciated the work done by their manager  but things were falling into place and they were certainly fitter than ever before  Compromises were made  differences were diminished  the relationship reconstructed  With victory came union  shared purpose We believed at difficult moments Javier Mascherano said on Sunday We overcame adversity  We laughed when we had to laugh and suffered when we had to suffer His message on Sunday night was important  his message that night  following the   win  was even more vital  The Chief playing chief Beating Atle tico then was the start  beating them now was the end  Barcelona won six in row  lost once  won six in row again  then drew one  then won six in row again  They went an entire vuelta  playing every team in the league  winning   drawing one and losing one  Then it came to Atle tico again  and they won at the Caldero to clinch the title   of  points  And that was just the league  they also reached the Copa del Rey final  beating Atle tico twice more en route from no wins in six last season to four wins in four this  And they reached the Champions League final in Berlin  winning in Manchester and Paris and beating Bayern  game of powerful symbolism Since beating Atle tico in January  Barcelona have won  and lost only two in   that league match against Ma laga and last week defeat in Munich  defeat of little consequence If you lose  they kill you  if you play OK or well  they still criticise Luis Enrique said  Even as they were winning  there were debates about the style  about whether they were really that good  But slowly they slipped away  Beating Madrid helped  the way they won in Manchester and Paris helped even more  By the time Pep Guardiola described them as the best counterattacking team in the world  it did not sound like such dirty word because they also counterattacked  they did not only counterattack Our games don look like handball any more Gerard Pique  said There is photograph from that Atle tico game that will probably come to define this season  Messi  Sua rez and Neymar running off celebrating together  an arm around each other shoulders  On Sunday night  Sua rez was forced to sit out with calf injury but when the final whistle went he ran on like the rest of them  wearing his shirt  piling into the celebratory circle  Another picture was taken  Messi  Neymar and Sua rez again  celebrating the title  secured with their  th goal this season I have never seen trio like it Pique  said this week  It seemed obvious now but at that point back in January  no one else had really seen it yet Sua rez had arrived late  not making his debut until week nine  He has  league goals now  his goal against Atle tico that night in January was only his second  It took while  Sua rez admitted that Messi had encouraged his shift of position back into the middle  The three men  who genuinely get on well  compliment each other perfectly  Sua rez has been exactly what they needed  scoring the winner in the cla sico which set up this title challenge and embodying the shift in style  Neymar has over  goals more than last season  As for Messi  well  he Messi   goals   assists and that surreal sensation that however good the stats are they re still not good enough Around them  the team has got ever stronger  They have kept  clean sheets  conceding just  this season The numbers say much Luis Enrique noted  The midfield have started to dominate too  At times it felt like this season was not about the midfielders  victims of more direct style  running more than they were passing  But the feeling in these final weeks is the complete opposite  Here  they were at the heart of it once more Cava was sprayed  Players shouted and bounded up and down  There may be two finals left  and there will be no open top bus parade until the end  but Barcelona players and staff insisted that they would be celebrating this properly and supporters headed down the Ramblas with fireworks and flags  Outside the Caldero  the team bus lurched back and forwards awkwardly trying to squeeze its way through tiny gap  Perhaps they should have let Messi drive  At pm  it finally edged its way uneasily onto the   and set off towards Barajas airport and from there to El Prat  where more fans were waiting On board  Sua rez was contemplating his first real league title and he was not alone  This was first for Neymar too  and for Mathieu and for Ivan Rakitic I can describe how feel Mathieu said My throat hurts from celebrating Rakitic smiled This is very important to me   don know about the others  Xavi  Iniesta  Messi they have won lots of titles  This was Xavi   rd title for his club  Messi has already won seven leagues in  year career  plus three European Cups  Iniesta scored the winning goal in the World Cup final  Alongside Pique Dani Alves  Sergio Busquets and Pedro  they might even win second treble  something no other club in European football has ever done  But you need only see them bound past underneath the stand at the Caldero and out through the iron doors at the north end to the bus to see that it mattered to them  really mattered  Not least because four months ago  few thought it was really possible  But then that night Barcelona beat Atle tico Madrid  And on Sunday night they beat them again   And so here we are   with one week to go  the title is decided and so is one of the relegation spots  Co rdoba are down but pretty much everything else is still open   Atle tico   points  and Valencia  are still fighting for third place and direct qualification for the Champions League  Valencia could yet not reach the Champions League at all  they re fourth with  points and Sevilla are just one point behind them in fifth  on  Next up  Ma laga Sevilla  Granada Atle tico  Almeri v Valencia   Two nil down  Athletic Bilbao won  with In aki Williams getting   rd minute winner  making him the first black player to ever score in La Liga for Athletic and meaning that they are well placed to take seventh place  very likely to be the final Europa League slot  They re on  points with Ma laga on  and Espanyol on   Next up  Ma laga Sevilla  Athleticv Villarreal  Celta Espanyol  Villarreal are guaranteed sixth    Granada miracle continues  They won   at Real Sociedad  their third win in row under their new manager  Jose  Ramo Sandoval  having previously won just four in  games all season  Meanwhile  Eibar could only draw   at Getafe and Almeri were beaten by Sevilla  despite having taken the lead  Deportivo win against Levante gives them chance of survival but their opponents emerged safe for another season  It not done by any means  particularly when you look at the fixtures waiting each team  Eibar  against Co rdoba  and Deportivo  against Barcelona  face teams with nothing to play for  although visiting the Camp Nou won be easy for the latter  while relegation battlers and third place chasers meet in the other two games at the bottom  Going into the final week  it looks like this  Co rdoba  and down  Almeri   with the possibility of having three points deducted still Eibar   Deportivo   Granada   Next up  Granada Atle tico  Eibar Co rdoba  Almeri v Valencia  Barcelona Deportivo Results  Atle tico   Barcelona  Espanyol   Real Madrid  Co rdoba   Rayo  Villarreal   Ma laga  Valencia   Celta  Sevilla   Almeri  Getafe   Eibar  Elche   Athletic  Deportivo   Levante  Real Sociedad

Will Arsenal or Manchester United win the Premier League next season ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/18/arsenal-manchester-united-win-premier-league-title,football,Arsenal Although the nature of Thierry Henry criticism about Arsenal spine recently irked Arse ne Wenger  the legendary striker of old had point  An upgrade in the goalkeeping department is logical  Wojciech Szczesny  who started the season as first choice  and David Ospina  who finishes it  have had flaws exposed compared with the best around  In midfield  although Francis Coquelin has been revelation in blocking all and sundry  some contests require an anchoring player with added finesse  Morgan Schneiderlin esque addition would be welcome to complement the essentials Coquelin brings  Up front  an alternative improvement to Olivier Giroud probably the hardest signing to achieve is needed to take the next step  Danny Welbeck  in an injury hit season  has had some positive moments but is still to convince on the ruthlessness stakes  Spinally  only the centre back position looks well covered  especially as more is expected of the January signing Gabriel Paulista after half season adaptation time Manchester United  Balance  is rivalling  philosophy  for prominence in the Louis van Gaal lexicon as the manager points to his search for this in his squad It not question of how big or how many numbers of players  it how the balance is  When you have  for every position  two equal levelled players  then m happy he says of what is required this close season to make United serious contenders  The greatest threat here is if David de Gea departs and Van Gaal cannot recruit world class replacement for the goalkeeper  By signing  say  Tottenham Hotspur Hugo Lloris the Dutchman will hope to solve this  Yet the manager needs to recruit more  gun midfielder  Juventus Paul Pogba would suit  right back  Everton Se amus Coleman is being considered  central defender  the No  target is Mats Hummels  At least one striker  Harry Kane is one under consideration  And if Gareth Bale can be prised away from Real Madrid this would be clear game changer Arsenal The most costly points dropping department came against teams just below the Champions League contenders  Against Tottenham  Southampton  Swansea and Stoke  total of seven points out of possible  reveals where the biggest problem came  Over the season as whole there is an upward trend in terms of performance and Wenger needs for the sense of progression to continue  There are series of plus points from    Alexis Sa nchez seemingly bionic at times  has had superb first season in the Premier League  Mesut zil embroiders games with more authority now  couple of youngsters have emerged with great credit  notably the reducer Coquelin and the speedster right back He ctor Belleri  Santi Cazorla has shown leadership as well as luscious touches  The balance between the team has evolved  making Arsenal tougher to beat  They are still susceptible to defensive brain freezes but that problem is less chronic than before  If they can crank it up another few degrees in all departments they can get closer to the champions Manchester United There has to be an adjustment in the Van Gaal mentality  The scintillating Sir Alex Ferguson sides attacked with near wild abandon that terrorised the opposition on most game days  Caution is part of Van Gaal managerial nature so he will never put out cavalier United XIs in the manner of Ferguson but the  year old should be able to recalibrate his approach to go on the front foot more  At the moment Van Gaal instructs his players to hog possession  resulting in too many lateral passes  If he were to instruct them that aiming for the jugular should be the default position when roving forward his Manchester United would be transformed  To this end pace should become permanent characteristic so the arrival of the jet heeled Memphis Depay in the summer from PSV Eindhoven will help Arsenal First things first  speed out the blocks in the Premier League  Arsenal are in the habit of creating long points gathering runs after Christmas but there was too much to catch up this time after sluggish start  Avoiding their usual Champions League qualifier should be helpful on that front  Then and apologies if this sounds like stating the bleedin  obvious imposing themselves on Chelsea in head to head matches still feels like big deal  It is notable that after last season general catastrophes against the strongest opponents  the improvement has been marked with one enduring exception  Wenger actually walked off from away matches against the top four with more points than Jose  Mourinho did  Comparing top four performances with last season nightmares for Wenger shows that valuable lessons have been learned and confidence increased  But Chelsea remain under their skin  It is hard to overstate what win against the current champions could potentially do to Arsenal self belief Manchester United Van Gaal buzzword next season should be  consistency This term United have eked out results to finish in what is likely to be fourth position  which in the context of the uneven displays is good sign  But the manager is concerned sides are not being killed off  as was the case on Sunday at Old Trafford when Arsenal were allowed back into the contest to snatch   draw after being dominated for large passages  From mid March to mid April  when United defeated Tottenham  Liverpool  Aston Villa and Manchester City  Van Gaal side were transformed into fleet footed  high pressing proposition that steamrollered allcomers  The players should remember these performances and also become more savvy when holding marginal lead  as against Arsenal  Confidence continues to be rebuilt following last season shattering under David Moyes  and Wayne Rooney and company will hope to regain the killer focus Van Gaal says is missing Arsenal It generally comes down to tweaking  rather than radical changes  This is because the current season has provided evidence that lot of radical changes have been addressed  The familiar finger pointing not enough leaders  Fragility at set pieces  Where is plan  They are so predictable  Everyone knows about Arsenal soft centre  Why is the treatment room full to bursting  has become less necessary  Notably  in the medical department they seem considerably fitter at the end of this season  Overall they are not quite at the required level yet  The Monaco debacle and  more recently  the classic smash and grab executed by Swansea  demonstrate how they can still slump into bad habits of not making the most of their chances and getting suddenly caught the other end  Wenger famous  handbrake  description still undermines them sometimes  An improved mental focus won do any harm Manchester United The number of injuries was concern in the first half of the campaign  though the problems has since eased and Van Gaal last week professed himself content on the subject  Yet he and his staff should plot to ensure this does not occur again when the   campaign starts  as having squad clear of the disruption of injury is the base requirement for healthy competition and the establishment of fluid team rhythm  Van Gaal has made one major adjustment to the off field running of the club by ensuring the coming summer tour of America is only fortnight long and has two bases rather than the planes  trains and automobiles nature of last year slog across the country  The flip side of this is that the manager and his charges really have no excuses for failing to prepare properly for next season Arsenal Jack Wilshere  Has returned to fitness with great zest in his cameos  fully fit season would be liberating for him Manchester United Phil Jones  The sight of Chris Smalling leading Manchester United in the absence of Rooney against Arsenal was telling pronouncement of how Van Gaal views the defender  It immediately showed Jones status as lower in the manager eyes and suggested the next year will be fight for the  year old  Van Gaal remains intent on signing Hummels and the German would expect to go straight into the team to partner Smalling in central defence  pushing Jones out 
Roberto Carlos free kick against France   recreated Sensible Soccer style,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/18/roberto-carloss-free-kick-against-france-recreated-sensible-soccer-style,football,Sensible Soccer was always computer game that rewarded bit of swerve  bash the ball forward  find the right angle on the left hand side  launch the ball at goal and then wrench on the joystick with all your might Many match was won in that fashion  the old succession of diving headers moving the ball the length of the pitch technique was an old favourite too  but the amount of movement on the ball was never particularly realistic Well  until  that is  Roberto Carlos famous swerving free kick for Brazil against France in  showed just what could be done with straight run up and furious swish of the left peg  And now that goal has been recreated  Sensible style It a lovingly accurate recreation from the folk at  bitfootball  right down to Fabien Barthez hopeless look of despair and befuddlement as the ball fizzes back from yards outside of his left hand post

Frosinone join Carpi to Lotito discomfort with fairytale promotion,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/18/capri-frosinone-promotion-serie-a,football,The end of Italian football is nigh  Or at least  that is how Claudio Lotito may view things  The Lazio owner had much to celebrate on Saturday night  his team taking another big stride toward the Champions League as they won   away to Sampdoria  But his joy will have been tempered by the news that Frosinone had secured their promotion to Serie earlier in the same day To most observers  this was footballing fairytale  Frosinone represent town of    people  tucked in among the Ernici and Lepini mountain ranges just south of Rome  Their team  first founded in  has never competed in Serie  This time last year they were playing in the Lega Pro Italy third tier Lotito  though  takes less romantic view  He made that much clear during now infamous phone call to Pino Iodice  director at the Lega Pro club Ischia Isolaverde  which was published on the website of La Repubblica this February  In among broader discourse on Italian football power structures  and his own importance within them  Lotito stressed the damage that he felt would be done by having smaller clubs promoted to the top flight Specifically  he referenced both Frosinone and Carpi the latter representing town of    people in Emilia Romagna  The transcript ran as follows I said to  the Serie president  Abodi Andrea  we need to change  If you bring me up Carpi   One can come up   If you bring me teams who are not worth fuck  in two or three years we will not have lira left   Because when go to sell the TV rights which brought in   bn thanks to my skill  managed to bring Sky and Mediaset together  in  years nobody had managed that in three years  if we have Latina  Frosinone  who the fuck will buy the rights  They don even know that Frosinone exist  Carpi supporters responded with wit  presenting banner at their next home game that read Lotito  il tuo calcio ci fa Skyfo They were telling the Lazio owner that his view of football disgusted them but intentionally misspelled the final word  schifo  in nod to the broadcasters whose views he professed to represent Their team came up with an even better response  sealing promotion to the top flight at the end of last month  Two and half weeks later  Frosinone have now joined them  As the latter club president  Maurizio Stirpe  remarked on Saturday evening Lotito is great soothsayer  He saw it all coming  If the Lazio owner was no doubt correct that Carpi and Frosinone with average attendances of   and   respectively hold less appeal to broadcasters than rivals such as Bologna or Bari  then he might also have wanted to consider the positive example each club can set  Neither appears to have spent beyond their means to reach this point  building their success not on the backs of overpaid stars but instead well rounded collectives At time when prominent figures within Italian football have expressed anxiety about the lack of opportunities being afforded to young domestic talents  Carpi arrive boasting first team squad whose average age is just  years old  and which contains only handful of foreign players  Their annual player wage bill is paltry m     They turned profit  even if only very modest one     on their accounts for  Frosinone squad is little older  with an average age of   but once again dominated by Italians  The stars of this campaign have been pair of journeyman lower league strikers  Daniel Ciofani and Federico Dionisi   and  respectively  have played combined four games of top flight football in their careers but have banged in  goals between them this season in Serie Both clubs will need to strengthen to survive at the highest level but they do have good role models to follow  Empoli have comfortably kept afloat in Serie with squad whose combined salary at the start of this campaign stood at   Sassuolo have stayed up for two consecutive seasons by relying on core of cheap Italian footballers The Neroverdi had just one foreign player in the team that beat Milan   this weekend  Saphir Tai der put in so so shift before being substituted early in the second half but the stage belonged principally to his team mate Domenico Berardi  After scoring four against Milan in the corresponding fixture last season  the Italy Under  striker had to settle for three this time around His first goal  admittedly  should never have stood  The Milan goalkeeper Diego Lo pez blundered in allowing an unremarkable shot to bounce off his chest but recovered to pull the ball back before it had crossed the line  Somehow  the fourth official saw things differently Such errors will hopefully be eliminated in Serie next season  when Hawk Eye will be introduced to help adjudicate on goalline decisions  It was supposed to be given first run in this season Coppa Italia final between Lazio and Juventus but that plan has now been aborted after the game was moved from the end of the season to the middle of this week This late switch brought on by Juventus success in reaching the Champions League final  scheduled to take place one day before the original Coppa Italia final date has led to entirely predictable problems that the footballing authorities have  entirely predictably  failed to prepare for Lazio had been due to face Roma this coming Sunday  in derby with huge implications for the top three race  Lotito has protested that it is unfair to play this game so soon after the rescheduled cup final  and requested that it be moved back by one day to Monday  May  Roma are less keen on this switch  as indeed will be the many hundreds of fans  and  ahem  journalists  with travel and hotel plans constructed around the game A decision is expected from the league by the end of today  Unlike in the cases of Frosinone and Carpi  the suspicion is that this time Lotito will get his way   Lotito Lazio  incidentally  remain one point behind Roma in the standings after the Giallorossi recovered from goal down to beat Udinese on Sunday night  Roma remain very long way from the team that we saw in the first half of this season but if any one player has maintained high level throughout then it is Radja Nainggolan  who scored his fifth goal of the season and very nearly added stupendous second  meeting Juan Iturbe cross with glorious inside of the heel flick that Orestis Karnezis just barely managed to push on to the post   Also in that game  first Serie goal for Udinese  year old Chelsea loanee Stipe Perica   Lazio goal against Sampdoria was scored by Santiago Gentiletti in what was the defender first appearance after an eight month injury lay off  The setting might have provided him with an additional layer of closure  He had torn his knee ligaments in the first place at the Marassi  during   loss to Genoa in September   Cagliari have now been mathematically relegated  after defeat at home to Palermo  Their slide into Serie had been on the cards for months but they had hoped at least to achieve stay of execution against opponents who had won only twice away from home all season  Their caretaker manager  Gianluca Festa  insisted on taking his share of the blame afterwards but suggested that he would be willing to stay on next season if the club was keen  He has collected seven points from his five games in charge   Noteworthy from that game was the omission of Paulo Dybala from Palermo team  Giuseppe Iachini  the coach  confirmed that the player who has scored  goals this season would be sold to Juventus this summer but added that the Argentinian strike partner was expected to remain  Franco  Va zquez said he does not know where he will play next year  The club wants to keep him said Iachini Dybala  on the other hand  is Juventus player  We are working for the future    low key Derby Italia at San Siro on Saturday  Juventus beating Internazionale even with weakened side  The Nerazzurri had started well  Mauro Icardi opening the scoring with his sixth strike in five Serie appearances against Juve before Marcelo Brozovic had goal wrongly disallowed for offside  But Inter reminded us of their defensive frailty soon enough with Nemanja Vidic giving away his fourth penalty of the season after being outpaced by Alessandro Matri  Claudio Marchisio equalised from the spot before lvaro Morata put Juventus in front with the help of goalkeeping howler from Samir Handanovic  Inter remain in the Europa League hunt only because Genoa were denied Uefa licence   Things might have worked out differently for Inter  of course  if it were not for the outlandish efforts of Marco Storari  Even at  he must still be one of Europe best back up goalkeepers   As for Genoa  that nine goals in two games for Gian Piero Gasperini team  Iago Falque alone has scored  goals since the start of  Results  Atalanta   Genoa  Cagliari   Palermo  Internazionale   Juventus  Roma   Udinese

Shock rout of Galaxy shows Orlando City may be closer than previously thought,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/18/shock-rout-of-galaxy-shows-orlando-city-may-be-closer-than-previously-thought,sport,It had been coming  Two months after sold out Citrus Bowl welcomed Orlando City into MLS  the Lions finally gave themselves something to truly celebrate in front of their own fans  Kaka scored the franchise first top flight goal back in March and the Brazilian was instrumental in delivering its first home win at the sixth attempt  scoring and contributing an assist in   thumping of the LA Galaxy This should have been the biggest shock of the  season so far expansion team dismantling the incumbent MLS Cup champions but it didn really feel like it  Orlando had been threatening such victory for quite some time  having lucked out in previous games at the Citrus Bowl  This time  however  everything aligned with Kaka growing in influence and productivity in almost every match Indeed  the Brazilian designated player and franchise poster boy was the driving force behind the win and the driving force behind Orlando as team in general but the performance of Cyle Larin was just as eye catching  if not quite as polished  The No  pick of this year draft has four goals in six starting appearances this season  three in his last three with his goalscoring display against the Galaxy arguably his best of the season  The second half cameo of Martin Paterson  whose MLS career has been hindered from the off by pre season hamstring injury  was another positive for the Lions Many maintain that Orlando is just top level striker away from being play off stick ons in the East with  Javier Hernandez to Florida  now staple of the MLS transfer gossip column but with Larin settling into his new side so quickly  does Adrian Heath already have that player  Sure  there are still some rough edges to Larin game  There were times against LA when his inexperience shone through like when he decided to shoot from  yards out  rather than make the most of two on one situation following loose backpass by Leonardo but Larin is already making good on his obvious potential The impression made by Larin was in contrast to that of the LA Galaxy own promising  young striker Bradford Jamison IV  With Robbie Keane still out through injury the West coasters are struggling for attacking traction  as well as midfield structure following the departure of Marcelo Sarvas in the off season  Bruce Arena admitted that his Galaxy side was  awful  in Florida  and while the MLS veteran might not truly care about regular season form until about July he must be concerned by the five game winless run LA currently find themselves on  GRLast week  after defeat to  man New York Red Bulls in the inaugural New York derby  David Villa claimed his team had hit  rock bottom  statement that frankly looked profoundly optimistic after half an hour of his team next game  with NYCFC   down at home and down to ten men against rampant looking Chicago Fire attack Just as had happened few weeks previously  the NYCFC defense had no answer for the pace of David Accam  and once again foul on the speedy Chicago midfielder led to red card  As the game drifted towards half time NYCFC looked in disarray But if rock bottom is the point at which the only way is up  the events that followed suggested that just maybe  the first half of NYCFC Chicago Fire on Friday  May  may mark the moment when the expansion NYCFC team hit rock bottom  and when Villa in particular announced his arrival in New York Villa tenacity drove his team back into the game  and got his reward in injury time when  surrounded by Chicago defenders on the edge of the Fire box  he managed to set up Khiry Shelton for his first ever MLS goal a toe poked shot that found its way past the keeper and inside the far post And at the end of the first half it was Villa rasping drive that was parried only as far as Medhi Ballouchy  who continued an unlikely run as his team leading scorer by tucking away the rebound and giving NYC the unlikeliest of lifelines going into half time Yet for all that New York fought hard in the second half  to set what Jason Kreis described as benchmark for what they could achieve through commitment and effort  this was just as much story of Chicago yet again squandering an advantage  Yet again they left game they should have been long out of sight in  wondering how they dropped points A lack of ruthlessness in front of goal is the main problem the Fire created numerous chances but seemed too relaxed in their finishing  Last season draw specialists are showing signs of being at it again  in conference where the frontrunners tend not to make those sort of errors against the also rans New York meanwhile  rode their luck at times perhaps enjoying the distinct novelty of their being any luck to ride  And at the end it was apt that Shelton  who has been willing and urgent runner from day one  should be the player who got them symbolic result  NYC look different side with Villa on the field as the focus and occasionally as an outlet for the team of relative strangers around him trying to find their bearings  but if there been positive so far this season it been in the example of the hardworking younger players like Shelton and patrick Mullins  who ve tried to take their opportunities to play with vigor Now to play themselves away from rock bottom  GPHaving scored his second in the Seattle Sounders  Cascadia clash against Vancouver  Chad Barrett looked back at his teammates arms outstretched  head nodding  lip upturned  almost as if to question why so much fuss had been made over Obafemi Martins  absence  Who needs Martins  Well  in the longer term  Seattle  but Barrett offered timely reminder of his worth as an MLS veteran by striking both goals in Seattle road win over the Vancouver Whitecaps His second goal was particularly impressive  finding the far corner of the net with cross goal half volley capping wonderful Seattle passing move which saw at least  exchanges made before the through ball was played forward to Barrett  It turns out the Sounders don necessarily need Martins or Dempsey to score goals as great revelation as that may be There is certain snobbishness when it comes to public perception of Barrett  Sure  he not the most technically adept player and there is something rather cumbersome and unfashionable about his game  but the  year old scoring record stands up reasonably well over the years even taking into account the fairly dismal spell in New England  The guy even has an international cap to his name  so is he really as bad as has been made out recently Of course  Barrett is nowhere near the standard of someone like Martins and the Sounders are significantly better side with the Nigerian striker in the team  Yet the former might feel slightly aggrieved that he hasn been afforded more of chance at Seattle since moving to the Pacific Northwest last year  Barrett was key to the Sounders  US Open Cup run last season  but has had to make do with substitute cameos and sporadic appearances as distinctly second rate  maybe even third rate  option in MLS But it wasn just Barrett goalscoring performance that provided highlight for Sigi Schmid and the Sounders  Seattle held the Caps at arm length for much of the match  enjoying prolonged spells of possession that gave Schmid side degree of shrewd game management that they had desperately lacked in the defeat to the Columbus Crew the week before  Seattle recognised that by closing down the space and sitting deep when faced with pressure  they could deny Vancouver the chance to break in behind at pace  It worked  with the Sounders comprehensive in victory  Stefan Frei  who was rarely bothered by Vancouver  even described the performance as Seattle best of the season Seattle now return back to CenturyLink Field after three game stretch on the road which gives their tally of  points from  fixtures little extra distinction  Even without Martins who is sidelined with tibial contusion the Sounders are force in the West  They still have Barrett and for all the derision and mocking that not such bad thing  GRIt might seem strange that the two games that might be described as bellwethers for the progress of FC Dallas under Oscar Pareja would not be games when their at times exhilarating attack swept all before it  but two   draws When Dallas exited the playoffs on away goals last year  they did so after   draw at home against the Sounders  that was followed by creditable   draw in Seattle where they shook the presumptive favorites up and demonstrated tactical maturity to go with the speed and invention that the likes of Fabian Castillo and Mauro Diaz bring to the side And in regular season game against the visiting Red Bulls this weekend  Dallas met an opponent with something of cerebral air about them these days  since the addition of coach Jesse Marsch and new found tactical sophistication  But if we expected full on assault on the New York goal  and for the Red Bulls solely to bunker and counter smartly  what happened instead  from both sides  was something subtler  and made for one of the more entertaining and absorbing   draws in recent MLS memory Castillo in particular found himself nullified by some determined and concentrated marking by Red Bulls  defenders  prompting Dallas to adjust their balance and work the ball in from other angles  Their tempo and pattern of play varied constantly as they looked for an advantage the opening of the second half saw them swarm forward in numbers in bid to overwhelm the Red Bulls around the outside  while later in the game  they were playing more cautious game trying to draw New York out and get behind them that way But for Felipe clearance off the line in the second half it might have worked  but it worth noting there were two teams contributing to the pattern of this game and the Red Bulls too demonstrated growing sophistication in the way they paced themselves then looked to kick for home with three points in the final  minutes That final  minutes was chess game in itself  as Pareja and Marsch appeared to be swapping substitutes at each other  determined not to be out thought  let alone outfought  by their opposite number Neither prevailed  and for the Red Bulls that will go down as decent point on the road  For Dallas though  the disappointment of not picking up home win should be set against performance where young team were not found wanting for concentration and sophistication  and for showing several of the qualities that should see Dallas make the leap from playoff irritants to the likes of Seattle  to credible contenders  GPUnder ordinary circumstances winless streak stretching well into May would have returned familiar sense of disgruntlement and exasperation to the Montreal Impact this season  That streak has now been broken rather shattered into million pieces following the   statement win over Real Salt Lake  underlining that the Impact campaign cannot be summed up by their current league position at the foot of the Eastern Conference  given their run all the way to the Concacaf Champions League final and continued assault on the Canadian Championship With the final of the latter competition not until August Montreal can finally settle into their MLS season having played just six games up until this point  From  May  Klopas  team will play four fixtures in just two weeks as they play catch up with the rest of the league  And there was certainly enough in the thumping of RSL particular in rampant opening  minutes during which they went   up to hint that Montreal can make the most of the upcoming run of games Dilly Duka was exceptional  as were Ignacio Piatti and Andres Romero as the supply line to Dominic Oduro  but it was the performance of Scottish midfielder Callum Mallace that caught the eye most especially considering the manner with which he dominated Kyle Beckerman  who was uncharacteristically sluggish  in the center of the pitch  In fact  the way Montreal imposed themselves all over the pitch was notable  scoring their first goal from set piece since  when Laurent Ciman knocked Marco Donadel corner kick after just  minutes  The Impact are finally in position to translate some of their CCL form into domestic streak The outlook is less positive for Real Salt Lake  If Jeff Cassar thought his side had moved on from the   thumping at the hands of the New England Revolution last month  he was given rude rebuttal at Stade Saputo  This was another red wedding for RSL after that defeat in Foxborough  Not even the Northern army suffered such annihilation twice RSL once boasted the strongest spine in MLS  but the identity that sustained them for their best years under Jason Kreis has now been compromised  Perhaps the biggest challenge for the club current coach will be finding fitting role for Luis Gil  who could be the key to unlocking Salt Lake stuttering offense  The problem for Cassar is that although Gil is an innately creative player  he not necessarily No  So how does RSL build their team around player that for all his undoubted promise  doesn have an obvious position  Maybe Cassar should ask Klopas on how to get the best out of fluid  interchangeable frontline  because on the basis of Saturday game the Montreal coach is on to something  GR

Football   talking points from this weekend action,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/18/football-ten-talking-points-weekend-action,football,In Manchester United   draw in the final home match of the season on Sunday  Old Trafford may have bade farewell to David de Gea  Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao as each player future at the club is unclear  While De Gea seems more and more certain to depart for Real Madrid  where Van Persie and Falcao could play next season intrigues  As loanee from Monaco the Colombian could play there once more though Jorge Mendes  his agent  has hinted the centre forward will move elsewhere if United reject the chance to take him permanently Manchester United will also listen to offers for Van Persie but whether he and Falcao can find another elite club interested in them is the big question  The answer  if one or both do leave  may be in Italy where Serie s slower pace suits the footballer heading to the autumn of his career  The other part of this conundrum is whom Louis van Gaal might recruit in their place  should they leave a poser that is even more of headache regarding De Gea  Clearer is that the manager is about to enter close season of transfer wheeling and dealing that promises to be trickier than any for few years harder even than the farrago under David Moyes two summers ago  Jamie JacksonSteve Bruce has never beaten Manchester United as manager but anything less than victory against his old club on Sunday will see Hull consigned to the Championship once again Maybe Man owe me something after wrecking my knee and my hip and my ankle said Bruce in the aftermath of Hull   defeat to Tottenham  but it is going to be hugely difficult task for City to retain Premier League status  All Newcastle need is home win against West Ham to drag themselves clear  while Sunderland require only point from two matches  That said  if Hull play as they did at White Hart Lane they have an opportunity  They were undone by two goals in quick succession but dominated for spells  Bruce dismissed the Jake Livermore situation as contributing factor for the defeat  but the timing of the midfielder positive test for cocaine could hardly have been any worse  It is all set up for tense afternoon  James RiachIt has become common practice at lot of grounds to wheel out former favourites for half time interview and there nostalgia was plentiful as Trevor Sinclair and Darren Peacock trundled out to utter few club friendly words at Loftus Road  The applause was thunderous as Sinclair urged QPR to get back to basics We need to go old school and get some scouting around the country to find some players he said  Peacock inspired heartfelt clapping when he added his opinion that the club need  young  hungry  ambitious players The message resonated with fans fed up of watching the worst of handsomely paid yet bloated and unbalanced squad struggle to perform in relegation season  In the old days that they hearken back to  Sinclair was signed from Blackpool and Peacock from Hereford  QPR want to put together tighter unit in the Championship  comprising core of players with something to prove and aspire to  The youngsters given some game time by Chris Ramsey have been refreshing  as demonstrated by the lively second half produced by the  year old striker Reece Grego Cox  While they will clearly miss players such as Charlie Austin and Rob Green  the standout performers this season in spite of QPR position  the club are ready for clean slate  Amy LawrenceAs Liverpool head into their final fixture of the season question many may be asking is just what formation will Brendan Rodgers deploy at Stoke  It has almost become game in itself  like bingo with deep lying midfielders and false No  It practically impossible to list the different formations Rodgers has used during the past nine months but among them have definitely been       with diamond midfield     and  against Crystal Palace on Saturday     Oh and that was change after Liverpool had begun in   formation again While there is nothing wrong with tactical flexibility  and indeed it is trait to admire in any coach  there comes point where the man in charge has to form defined way of playing for his team and Rodgers  now at the end of his third season at Anfield  has surely reached that point  In his defence  the loss of Luis Sua rez to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge to long term injury forced the Northern Irishman to rejig the way he set up the team so successfully last season  but even then there were tweaks and alterations to Liverpool formation that must have been as confusing to his players as they were to spectators This season Rodgers found great success with   formation  having deployed it for the first time against Manchester United in mid December  Liverpool remained undefeated from then until they again met Louis van Gaal side in mid March  but following defeat to them and then to Arsenal soon afterwards he abandoned it only to then bring it back for the FA Cup semi final against Aston Villa  which Liverpool lost after the most bewildering  minutes of formation changes  Rodgers may well have broken some sort of record All this tinkering  surely  has to calm down next season if Liverpool are to enjoy season more productive than this one  The team are crying out for sense of order and defined way of playing  If Rodgers is looking for guide than here it is  build the team around Philippe Coutinho  He a sensational player  Sachin NakraniIt has been an enjoyable few months for Aaron Lennon at Everton  He may have looked less than pleased when he joined them on loan from Tottenham in January but he has been playing with smile on his face since then and  although he did not contribute much in the win against West Ham  Roberto Marti nez will be sad to see him go back to White Hart Lane  It was Lennon final appearance this season he will not be able to play against Tottenham on Saturday  But will we see him in an Everton shirt next season  It seems unlikely that Lennon has future at Tottenham  so perhaps there is deal to be done  not that Marti nez was giving anything away I think you have to ask that to crystal ball Everton manager said I think Aaron has been phenomenal  really successful loan period  That the end of that loan and we will see what happens in the future but the memories will be there for ever Jacob SteinbergIt has been largely season of struggle at Sunderland for the Liverpool loanee centre half  Now  though  the Uruguayan seems to have recovered from the serious knee problems that hampered his Anfield career and is showing his class at the heart of Dick Advocaat defence  Largely overlooked by his compatriot Gus Poyet Sunderland former manager preferred Santiago Vergini Coates had hardly featured until Advocaat offered him start at Stoke last month  Since then Coates has shone  both when paired with Wes Brown and  as against Leicester  John Shea  Poyet reluctance to offer him first team chances looks increasingly ill judged  Louise TaylorSwansea have missed out on playing in the Europa League again and what blessing in disguise that could be  Garry Monk never said as much  and the way that his team approached Sunday game against Manchester City suggested they were desperate to pick up the three points that would have kept them in with chance of finishing in the top six  but it hard to come to any other conclusion other than that they will be better off without playing in Europe given the disruption to the domestic season that the Europa League causes  This is not case of putting Premier League survival ahead of winning silverware  Swansea proved two years ago  when they won the League Cup  that they take knockout competitions seriously  and Huw Jenkins  the chairman  has made it clear in the past that he will not tolerate talk of getting to the  point mark  But until the Europa League format is streamlined  and the matches are moved to Tuesday or Wednesday night rather than Thursday  it is hard to make case for being in the competition  especially for club with Swansea playing resources  and that is before we even mention the financial aspect  Stuart JamesTo put his record breaking achievement into context  Sadio Mane  was two years old when Robbie Fowler struck the now second fastest hat trick in Premier League history  In season in which the Senegalese has blown hot and cold  this was three minute exhibition of perhaps why his former mentor told the Guardian  touch bullishly  last October Today we talk about Messi and Neymar but honestly don think these players are as good as Sadio Mane  There was  however  evidence to suggest that the Barcelona duo still reign supreme  Mane  third goal was delight but his first two were fortunate and Southampton were themselves lucky to host an Aston Villa side  either saving themselves for the FA Cup final or  as the home fans were vocally suggesting  doing their utmost to impersonate the Sunderland side that sunk to an   defeat earlier in the season  Reaching Wembley and steering clear of relegation notwithstanding  defeats such as these do nothing for Tim Sherwood reputation  Quickfire capitulations away trips to Chelsea  Liverpool and West Brom  although Spurs did recover to draw  spring to mind punctuated the rousing victories he achieved at Tottenham and painted picture of manager who can rally the troops when backs are against the wall but is tactically exposed  He can enjoy the trip to Wembley but Sherwood will be judged on what he achieves over the summer when the chips are not down and there are no fires to fight  Gerard MeagherOver the course of this season  Danny Ings has proved himself to be more than deceptively unfriendly Countdown selection  Though he has scored only  goals in  appearances  he has shown himself to be player of enterprise and intelligence  good enough to enhance any squad in the country  At   he has many years of improvement to come  is English  and has proved that he can thrive in unfavourable circumstances  able to affect games even with lesser players behind and alongside him  In particular  he performed superbly at Old Trafford and the Etihad  where his all round game was constant threat  Very few centre forwards have the ability to occupy an entire back four but Ings is one  his presence  movement and touch handy  not only on their own merits but for the flexibility they permit whoever is lucky enough to manage him next season  Daniel HarrisIt is only in the last month or so that Nathan Redmond has regained his regular starting berth with Norwich City  having shown Alex Neil that he has developed his game  Since arriving at Carrow Road in January the manager has been encouraging Redmond to become more proactive and unpredictable in his movements instead of just patrolling the touchline  Against Ipswich on Saturday Redmond gave superb demonstration of what his manager had demanded  flitting cleverly around the pitch as he scored one goal  created the other two and generally showed not merely the dribbling skills that he has always had but also astute passing and crisp finishing  Given the way that Albert Adomah performed in Middlesbrough dismantling of Brentford  it looks as though wingers could have big influence on the outcome of the Championship final  Paul Doyle

Fifa and Qatar seemed like perfect partners on account of their mutual awfulness  But is the romance over ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/fifa-qatar-world-cup-press-freedom,commentisfree,Unless England end up doing uncharacteristically well or unless someone happens to invent horrible sounding musical instrument with funny name then have to admit that World Cup can often pass me by  So  really  hats off to Qatar  It isn hosting its World Cup for another seven years  but m already on the edge of my seat It probably worth clarifying  by the way  that am actually on the edge of my seat  haven moved beyond the boundaries of my seat  Please let not arrest me for trespassing For me  the only fun to be had during World Cup usually comes from watching Fifa get to act like terrifying cross between Galactus the intangible planet sapping Marvel comic entity and the spivvy looking one from Dad Army  Private Walker  now you ask Once every four years it sweeps into new country  drains it of cash and then hoofs it  leaving behind several hilariously oversized stadiums and selection of embarrassed looking politicians in its wake  It an especially efficient form of vampirism  one with its own official beer and mascot that invariably ends up looking like some sort of obliterated genital But in Qatar  it seems as though Fifa might have found its perfect partner in unethical behaviour  They re so well matched  in fact  that they re probably enacting rom com montage together as we speak  skipping through meadows  having pillow fights with sacks of money  tying women to trainlines and then twirling their moustaches and then high fiving each other  That sort of thing So  it would be shame if Fifa suddenly had to sever its connection to Qatar  And it really might  After all  that seems like the logical thing to conclude  based on Fifa decision to investigate the arrests of the four BBC journalists caught trespassing on worker accommodation compound Because Fifa investigations are profoundly rigorous  aren they  It took  months for it to fully investigate allegations of corruption following the successful Qatari World Cup bid  and it needed every single day of that to collate   pages of evidence  bin nine tenths of it and then exonerate itself to the dismay of the chief investigator  The man hours that must have gone into sieving the investigation for reputation saving nuggets of semi fact alone must be evidence of Fifa dedication This investigation  really and truly  might be what does it for Qatar  following on from the accusations of horrific human rights abuses that have cost over   workers their lives  So far  nothing has quite been serious enough for Fifa to pull the plug  but who knows  Suppression of press freedom might just be the last straw Qatar is certainly running out of places left to go  It already ticked off alleged corruption  mistreatment of immigrant workers and frighteningly iffy attitude to the LGBT community  and  is still miles away That can only mean one thing  To sustain this momentum of mutual awfulness  one can only assume that Fifa and Qatar have gained possession of some sort of giant radioactive egg that  when hatched  will wreak havoc across the world as we know it  Millions will die under this monster terrible feet  and the planet will be forced to build itself anew after its devastation is complete  But  still  at least if it Fifa the monster will have its own official beer  That something If you don hear from me this week  then it because ve dug hole for myself in the park  crawled into it and encased myself in concrete  Because m not going to watch the Mad Men finale until Thursday and  based on the sheer amount of internet chatter in the hours since its US broadcast  that the only way ll be able to get there spoiler free The dumbest thing is   it doesn even matter  To get knotted up about spoiling the end of any television series is simply preposterous waste of anyone energy  But to get knotted up about spoiling the end of Mad Men is an act of criminal stupidity  Any trace of narrative dynamism the show ever had vanished in puff of smoke about four years ago  and was replaced by number of elliptical short stories about the circularity of negative behaviour patterns Mad Men isn Breaking Bad  Its ending was never designed as part of its whole  It isn a show about druglord hurtling towards inevitable self destruction  It a show about bored looking alcoholic slowly drowning in sea of sideburns over the course of decade It little more than mood piece now  Any of its last  episodes could have reasonably functioned as its finale  and nobody would have been any the wiser  Unless this last episode ends with Don Draper unzipping his skin and revealing that he was actually three kids and dog stacked on top of each other all along  very little will actually be spoiled by finding out how it ends before watch it But still  don tell me how it ends  Especially if Don dies  He does die  right  No  don tell me 
The Guardian view on the English NHS  the seven day daydream,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/guardian-view-on-english-nhs-seven-day-daydream,commentisfree,The Conservative election victory was very much David Cameron personal win  Despite the wear and tear of five years in office  he has continued to outpoll his party  During the campaign  we were reminded why  Particular Tory policies on human rights  say  or on welfare might have been immoderate  but Mr Cameron was always able to wrap them up  often pretty convincingly  in the language of pragmatic common sense  After achieving his new mandate  he has stuck with this winning tone when he spoke of one nation government  Then today he used his first big speech as majority prime minister not to wallow in the Conservative comfort zone  but instead to address the issue that the Tories often find most thorny  the NHS A centrist speech reasserted NHS values  offered reassuring  if decidedly vague  undertaking not to privatise  and restated campaign commitment to find the bn that the English NHS is officially deemed to require  The particular problem that the PM highlighted the rigid organisation of services around office hours also fitted comfortably within the Cameronian commonsensical pitch  It is  as he said  appalling that mortality rates can be   higher on Sunday  and it would surely be better as he also suggested if services were organised around spikes in demand  not weekend rotas for skeleton staff The all important question  however  is what the prime minister imagines he can do about this  The  what counts is what works  pose is all very well  but citizens waiting longer in E corridors will have been more struck by what Mr Cameron didn talk about than by anything he actually said  There was no acknowledgement of rising delays for in  and out patients  nor of the great wave of rationing that two in five commissioning groups are signalling that they might soon embark on  There was nod at the ageing society  but no understanding that this will consume all of the vaunted bn and more That figure dropped out of plan by the NHS England chief  Simon Stevens  plan that made to add up only with the help of truly heroic  bn in efficiency savings  which include the assumption that pay can be screwed down for years without disrupting the service  While private sector wages were on the floor  this was often possible  But today  there are already shortages in nursing and general practice  and as the economy recovers filling vacancies without paying better might become impossible  Meanwhile  the  deficit that has just appeared in the books at St George  in south London  is emblematic of what the Health Service Journal describes as pattern of  major financial holes   opening up all over the acute sector holes totting up to bn or so How  in this context  are the resources going to be found to put  care in place  If instead the idea is sweating existing  resources  ie doctors and nurses to do more  more flexibly  then how is that going to be achieved  The British Medical Association is union that sometimes needs to be taken to task  but Mr Cameron could not pick this fight at this time and remain on the consensual centre ground  We would be talking about an industrial relations battle to rival those of the Thatcher years The PM who once styled himself as  man with plan  is leader flying by the seat of his pants  This was evident from another gaping omission from his speech  Andrew Lansley rewiring of the English NHS  Despite the vast energy this consumed  Mr Cameron is not even pretending it will further his round the clock ambitions  It seems fair to conclude that he has concluded that it was distraction Indeed  the very idea that it is for the health secretary  prime minister or anyone else in Whitehall to tell hospitals how to run their care runs counter to the marketopian Lansley philosophy  The confused and overlapping patchwork of autonomous NHS structures that Mr Lansley left behind could easily render Mr Cameron hopes of seven day care daydream  For no single autonomous hospital or commissioner  acting in isolation  could impose weekend working on staff  Without central coordination  employers who tried that would lose staff to others who didn  If he is serious about his latest plan  Mr Cameron might thus need to rip up his previous dismal effort 
The Guardian view on Nigel Farage  it all about Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/guardian-view-on-nigel-farage-all-about-europe,commentisfree,In the wasteland of electoral defeat  it is the voice that can most authoritatively account for the failings of the immediate past that shapes the debate about the future  That struggle is under way at the moment in all the defeated parties  headed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats  In their cases there is everything to be said for taking this process slowly in the hope of getting it right in way that will last  For them  the election campaign of  is likely to be fought in very different context from the last For one party  time is not luxury so readily available  Ukip emerged from May massively stronger in terms of voter support  with almost million votes  but with only one MP  Douglas Carswell in Clacton  The loss of Mark Reckless seat and the failure of Nigel Farage to win one meant the Ukip performance was not nearly as strong as seemed possible when it took   of the votes in the EU elections year previously  With European referendum perhaps only year away  the party is suddenly facing some hard questions in hurry Leaving the EU is Ukip founding principle  But Mr Farage bundled up leaving the EU with campaign focused on migrant workers from eastern Europe and wider anxieties about the level of immigration to construct populist anti establishment movement that at the election probably damaged Labour as much as the Conservatives  Ukip came second in   seats on May  perhaps setting it up to break through next time  Of the  where Ukip was closest  half were Labour held  prospect which  after Ed Balls defeat  has produced something close to panic in Labour circles Yet Ukip is itself in turmoil amid its advances  Part of this is about Mr Farage personality  But it is also about priorities and strategies and about the tensions between the inevitable focus on the EU in the referendum and longer term party prospects  Some in the Ukip leadership think the party could develop in the same way that Marine Le Pen has developed and broadened the appeal of the Front National  That is partly what sparked the spat at the end of last week which saw the exit of Raheem Kassam  one of Mr Farage closest advisers  who wanted Ukip to grow into something like British version of the American Tea Party  Mr Kassam departure will help those like Suzanne Evans  the deputy chair and author of the manifesto  who told the BBC that the party should diversify and become more inclusive  On the same programme  Mr Carswell suggested millions of voters who might have backed the party were put off by the Farage rhetoric Such critics plainly think Mr Farage is too divisive and unreliable to deliver majority to get the UK out of Europe in referendum  Yet he is also powerful campaigner against the EU when he puts his mind to it  Anti EU campaigners in the Tory party must also tread fine line between making common cause with Mr Farage and not letting him hijack the whole thing  It would be easy to be cheered by the fragility of the no campaign  That would be mistake  It is Ukip that is fragile  not the lobby to get Britain out of Europe 
Abracadabra  Britain political elite has fooled us all again,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/britain-political-elite-fooled-us-again,commentisfree,Magicians call it misdirection  directing the attention of crowd elsewhere so as to distract from the trick happening right in front of it  bump on the shoulder  blur of handwaving and wham  your wallet taken leave of your hip pocket Since the crash  British politics has been one epic act of misdirection  Lay off those bankers who shoved the country into penury  Just focus on stripping disabled people of their benefits  Never mind the millionaire bosses squeezing your pay  Spit instead at the minimum wage migrant cleaners apparently making us poorer  So ingrained is the ritual that when minister strides into view urging the need for  grown up debate we brace ourselves for another round of Blame the Victim  The only question is who gets sacrificed next  some ethnic minority  this family on low pay  that middle aged dad who can get job Here is how political misdirection works in real time  Yesterday  Unite Len McCluskey came under barrage of criticism for suggesting that Labour live up to its name and support  ordinary working people Evil paymaster  Meanwhile  on the front page of this paper  digger firm JCB called on David Cameron to prepare to take Britain out of the EU and this was just company having its say I hold no brief for McCluskey but he is the democratically elected head of trade union simply seeking to influence the party part funded by his members  Perhaps this comes as news to some on Fleet Street  but the debate over Labour future is not the chew toy solely of newspaper columnists  Moreover  Unite donations to Her Majesty Opposition are matter of easily checkable record  Not so the money poured into Tory coffers by JCB  either as business or from its owners  the Bamford family  To learn that  we must rely upon forensic researchers such as Stuart Wilks Heeg at Liverpool University  He calculated this morning that  between    the Bamfords and JCB had together given the Conservatives at least    One arm of JCB also donated    last year to Tory campaigns in key marginals  including the all important battleground of Nuneaton So company that funded David Cameron all the way into Downing Street  and whose chairman was recently made lord  seeks to influence the government on one of the most fundamental issues in British politics  something that affects all of us and this is business as usual  Yet workers  elected representative adding his voice to the din of an internal party argument somehow represents the biggest political landgrab since bloke with goatee popped in to the Winter Palace Expect more of this misdirection over the next few weeks  Labour has scheduled the entire summer for its leadership campaign  which could equal months of an entire party sounding like an indecisive satnav  Veer right  Keep left  Meanwhile  in just over month  George Osborne will lay out an emergency budget to deal with the enormous  bn deficit that he inherited from himself  Using the traditional lexicon of political hocus pocus  hard choices  he will begin making some of the extra  bn of welfare cuts the Tories pledged at the last election Every feat of misdirection is always intended to distract the audience from sleight of hand  The same goes in politics only here it aimed at taking our minds off the fact that all this jiggery pokery is actually making us worse off  Let me show you what mean  using figures calculated for the Guardian by academics at the Centre for Research on Socio Cultural Change  Cresc using official data  When Thatcher moved into No   of all working age households took more from the state in cash benefits  in health and education and all the rest of it than they paid back in taxes  In other words  more than one in four employers in Britain were failing to pay their staff way The next round of cuts will hit the working poor all over again  like hammer to the faceMore than three decades later  through Major and Blair and Brown and Cameron  that proportion has kept on rising  Now   of working age households rely on taxpayers to pay their way  Think about all those tax credits for low paid work  those exemptions for people earning too little even to be taxed  We have more people in work than ever before and more households than ever before relying on the state to keep them afloat There nothing wrong with these people  These are the hard working families politicians like talking about the strivers  the squeezed middle  the alarm clock Britain  But there a lot wrong with their employers because they now rely on taxpayers to top up poverty pay  even while insisting on cuts in corporation tax and grants for investment  Come July  it won be those businesses that the chancellor tells to change their ways it ll be the people they employ who will see more money taken out of their weekly budget by the cuts  Because the one thing we know about the next round of cuts is that they will hit the working poor all over again  like hammer to the face This is what politics looks like in Britain nowadays  once the newspapers have their japes and the politicians leave the TV studios  it is about justifying an extractive business class that wants to lean on taxpayers to pay their way  even while lecturing the rest of us about welfare dependency  And it doesn change all that much whether the Tories or Labour are in Downing Street  The Cresc team looked at who reaped the rewards from growth over the past three decades  Under Thatcher and Major  the top   of all working age households took p in every  of income growth  Under Blair and Brown  their share actually went up  to p in each   Cresc found that New Labour bumped up the share of the poorest economically active households from  to   Taxes and benefits evened that up bit the same taxes and benefits that are now deemed unaffordable  So much for trickle down This is what all the misdirection has been about  taking our minds off the fact that Britain is soft touch for businesses that want taxpayers to pay their way  and politicians who count on the middle classes to feel richer  not through their wage packets  but by their house prices  their no frills flights  their luxury buys from Lidl  What trick has been pulled on Britain by its political and business elite  never have so many people had their pockets picked at the same time 
David Cameron promise of  seven day NHS  is rooted in ignorance  not evidence,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/nhs-seven-day-health-reform-conservatives-cameron,commentisfree,David Cameron promise of  seven day NHS  is curious  The NHS is already available seven days and nights week  Out of hours GP services cover evenings and weekends  E departments are always open  and inpatients are treated around the clock at weekends  with consultants on call as on any other day  What seems implied is not new services at night and at the weekends  but better services  Yet the prime minister was not specific about what he has in mind  and any improvements will have costs GPs  the government again suggests  should open their surgeries at weekends  and consultants should do more work at weekends  But GP practices can already earn extra funding for providing  enhanced services  on weekday evenings or at weekends  What this has shown is that demand for access at these times varies considerably  according to the demographics of the populations concerned  some GPs think that if you assess demand carefully  almost all of it can be met within normal weekday hours  This suggests that blanket policy would waste resources  what would be helpful would be for NHS England to offer to assist every practice to work out the best way for it to meet the local demand In the meantime  it is hard to see how any improvement is possible  even by   given that there is critical shortage of GPs  Training takes five years  and newly qualified doctors are choosing other kinds of medical career than general practice  In addition  up to   of medical students are women  and many start families soon after qualifying one practice in east London currently has five pregnant GPs and has not had single application to cover the soon to be empty posts  In addition  most GPs choose to work part time  These facts  if they persist  would mean that the government will need to pay for training three or four potential GPs for every full time equivalent who will eventually practise  Jeremy Hunt says he wants half of all qualifying doctors to choose to be GPs  This may be less than is needed just to maintain existing services  let alone extend them The case for shifting some senior hospital medical staff hours from weekdays to weekends is also problematic  and the evidence that Cameron cited to justify it is disputed  Hospital admissions at weekends are different they rarely come from outpatient clinics  which are held on weekdays  most are emergency admissions and tend to be more serious  But it is not entirely clear that outcomes are worse for such patients than for comparably ill patients admitted on weekdays Supposing that the evidence did suggest that rearranging consultants  hours in order to spread them over seven day week would be beneficial  the implications of such shift would be immense  Consultants work with teams  it would affect every level of clinical staff  and the staff of all the diagnostic and other technical services that support surgical and non surgical care  it could even lead to fall in the quality of care overall The government is said to have learned that breaking its  election promise to have no more top down reorganisations of the NHS was politically costly  It seems improbable that it really wants to start another on this scale  third idea  floated by Hunt  is to shift responsibility from GPs to nurses  or perhaps new categories of clinical worker  to diagnose simple conditions  or give treatments or tests that that only GPs are currently authorised to provide  Such arrangements do exist in other comparable health services  though not as cost saving measure  and typically in countries with much higher ratios of doctors to patients than in the UK Sweden and Germany  for example  have   per thousand compared with the UK    That means less qualified staff can provide some treatments without the risk that serious illnesses will be missed  so that quality and continuity of care remain central  In current conditions in the UK  the risk is that it would reduce the quality of primary care and drive those who could afford it to  go private  Cameron assurance that people should  not assume  that it would cost more was visibly not shared by the NHS chiefThe attraction of reducing the skill mix is that it sounds like way of saving money  while the other ideas expanding the GP workforce by making it more attractive to be GP  and getting many more hospital staff  and GPs and their staff  to work more unsocial hours  would cost serious money  Cameron airy assurance that people should  not automatically assume  that seven day services would cost more was visibly not shared by the NHS chief executive  Simon Stevens  speaking after him at the same event Analysts at Nuffield Trust calculate that to maintain the present level of services the NHS will need  bn year more by  than it is getting now  The PM has pledged to give it just bn year more by then  relying on Stevens  view that the other  bn will be found from efficiency savings of  a year  But the efficiency savings already achieved under the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments came substantially from salary freezes  It is hard to find anyone familiar with the day to day reality in the NHS who thinks  bn year can be saved by  without major loss of coverage and quality  Meanwhile  George Osborne proposes to cut welfare spending by  bn year  implying predictable increase in demands on health services It is hard to avoid the impression that Cameron speech  whatever its intended political aim  lacks serious basis in policymaking 
Why choose to have less choice,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/choose-less-choice-shopping-around,commentisfree,Once  when was suffering fit of depression  walked into supermarket to buy packet of washing powder  Confronted by shelf full of different possibilities  stood there for  minutes staring at them  then walked out without buying any washing powder at all I still feel echoes of that sensation of helplessness  If just want to buy one item but discover that if buy three of the items will save myself half the item price  find myself assailed by choice paralysis I hate making consumer choices at the best of times  because have this uncomfortable suspicion that big companies are trying to gull me out of as much money as possible  using sophisticated techniques designed by people who are smarter than am For instance  when buy an insurance product  how can decide whether should just buy the cheapest  or the best  The best is the one most likely to pay out without penalty or fuss  but that information is much harder to find out than factors such as cost  extent of cover  etc  It complicated  So often try not to make choices by just putting my payments for insurance with my usual insurers on direct debit  for example  which means don have to think about shopping around This issue of choice and complexity lies at the heart of the experience of being modern  It penetrates commerce  politics and our personal lives  It may even be connected to the fact that there are higher levels of depression in society than ever before This idea was suggested by Barry Schwartz in his book The Paradox of Choice  Choice oppresses us  Why  Because there are too many choices and they are often too complex for us to be confident that we are making the right one When you might have   potential choices to make of particular style of camera  it is difficult to feel sure you have chosen the right one even if you spend an inordinate amount of time trying to make rational decision  Or you may see the same model two weeks after you ve bought it being sold more cheaply  When there was less choice and fewer types of camera  this kind of experience was rare  Our capacity for hindsight has become means of punishing ourselves Complexity is not entirely accidental  Late capitalism solves the dilemma of competition  for the producer  through complexity  To try to choose mortgage  or pension  or computer  requires tremendous amount of application  so we become relatively easy to gull  Whether it is power company or loan company  we struggle to understand tariffs  terms and the small print  Exhausted  we just take stab and hope for the best  or we succumb to inertia  choose what we have always chosen  Consumers are thrown back on simple cues that are advantageous to the producers  such as brand recognition Accept complexity which means accepting that you can never be sure you made the right choiceComplexity also impacts on politics  Once it was pretty clear who to vote for your class position  on the whole  made it simple matter of self interest for most voters  Now we have become closer to what is ironically the democratic ideal ie choice making actors voting is more of challenge than it once was  Do you really have good enough grasp of economic theory to judge whether it is best to spend or save in recession  Do you understand the complexities of private provision in the NHS enough to rule it out  Do you know enough about international affairs to support reduction in defence spending  or retreat from the EU  Most people don   so  again  they make snap judgments based on loyalty and sentiment This problem of choice and complexity is ubiquitous  It applies in medicine  If am ill and asked to make choice about treatment  would often rather leave the choice to the doctor  if only because if the wrong choice is made  am not going to feel nearly so bad about it  had prostate cancer scare recently  and just wanted to be told what to do not decide whether  say  should choose an operation that would guarantee impotency in order to stave off  chance of cancer  The burden of choice was too big In the field of education similar dilemma applies  Once your child went to the local primary or secondary  Now you have to decide from bewildering number of types of school  In the personal realm  once  you stayed married for life  Now  if you are in an unhappy marriage you have to decide whether to stay or not  These may be all positive developments  but they come at cost the potential for regret So how should one react to complexity  Schwartz suggests we should limit choice  not extend it  If you are shopping for food  go to supermarkets that are priced simply with limited range  such as Aldi and

Life doesn come with trigger warnings  Why should books ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/life-doesnt-come-with-trigger-warnings-why-should-books,commentisfree,Do we  as citizens of this uncomfortable and unpredictable world  have the luxury and privilege of receiving  trigger warnings  before being exposed to disturbing material about subjects like the Holocaust  lynching  murder and rape I taught courses in literature  creative writing and gender studies at the university level for  years without being asked for trigger warnings  But  during the past two years  more and more students have asked for them  They cite reasons similar to those given by the four Columbia university students who made headlines last week by insisting that Ovid Metamorphoses requires one because of rape scenes in the book Last year  when revising the curriculum for gender studies related course teach  omitted books with sexually violent material to protect my students from responding negatively  The one new book hadn read all the way through before assigned it  although researched the book and watched film based on it  contained gang rape scene from the point of view of young child  small group of students grumbled  One student  in an anonymous teacher evaluation  wrote Not providing trigger warnings is not only detrimental to students  emotional well being   but it also represents further invalidation insult of rape survivors  Providing trigger warnings  honestly  is less of request and more of student demand for this professor if she intends to teach this class again  It is statements like these that make me want to opt out of teaching this material all together I want to scream I care  This is why have chosen to teach difficult material  about the oppression of women and minorities  in the first place I worry that  by giving in to requests for trigger warnings  professors are telling this new generation of students that they need to be coddled I trying to understand  ve led workshops and conference panels about trigger warnings  In my Queer Literature course  gave out survey asking  would you want trigger warnings for every potentially triggering reading  Many said no and these are some of their reasons I would like to experience the novel without warning beforehand  think one purpose of triggers is to face deep trauma and to hopefully grow from it  This is the real world and bad things happen  Caring for those affected by these topics is also necessity  If someone is so shocked that they couldn deal with readings  they should really be seeking help professionally and not take the class at this time Other students disagreed  One said I think it is necessary to have uncomfortable conversations  but you need to be in the right frame of mind  I understand the need  if possible  to emotionally detach when discussing and reading about difficult topics  But isn discomfort the place where real learning takes place The American Association for University Professors  AAUP  issued harsh statement against the use of trigger warnings in the academy  saying The classroom is not the appropriate venue to treat PTSD  which is medical condition that requires serious medical treatment  I whole heartedly agree with the AAUP statement  But still struggle As courtesy  have begun providing blanket content warning on my syllabi  Of course  there is no way to know which issues will be triggering for which students  On the first day of class ask students to be aware of the possibility of triggers throughout the semester and to take care of themselves if they feel triggered to seek counseling  to step out of the room  to talk with me  If text contains blatant sexual abuse  ll most likely give content warning  But not always Last month  showed the film Thelma and Louise  asked myself if should give warning about the film attempted rape scene  decided not to  The scene needed to be surprise  as it a major plot point and reason for the characters to embark on their journey I want to tell my students  sometimes might not warn you  Not out of malice  but because care  Because the outside world is full of triggers  Because any number of things  at any point of any day the first few notes of pop song  or the smell of french fries  or looking into the eyes of the man behind you at the bank can trigger you  And you need to be ready and strong  You need to be prepared 
Labour did not cause the economic crisis it must counter the myth that it did,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/labour-economic-crisis-tories,commentisfree,The first priority of the next Labour leader should be to address head on the idea that the party was somehow responsible for the global financial crisis  Of course  it wasn  the fact that so many people believe this is down to some brilliant politics from the Conservatives The combination of an exhausted Labour frontbench  an inward looking leadership election  recession  and an unfortunate joke note left on Treasury desk set the scene for confident Conservative party to ram that message home in   and nothing Ed Balls said over the past few months could counteract that  Nor should we forget why the Conservatives were so eager to seize that chance  they saw the opportunity to wipe out the achievements of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown  who demonstrated  over many years of hard graft  that the country economic management was safe in Labour hands The late Philip Gould  one of Blair key strategists  wrote in his diary in    We must sort out the economic policy as almost discrete  separate product  sorted out and got right  and made into the bedrock of our credentials for government  Unfortunately there is no getting away from the fact that Labour now needs to do that again  First it needs to give itself the confidence to start that journey  Because frankly  if it were true that Labour incompetence had caused the global financial crisis  the party would not deserve to govern  But the facts do not support that In  the International Monetary Fund published estimates of the country of origin of the bad debts that were floating around global financial markets that eventually caused the banks to seize up  The value of these  toxic assets  that originated in the US was   tn  compared to   bn in the whole of the Europe and Asia combined  This was not problem that was primarily created in the UK  it arose from financial deregulation in the US so much so that the outgoing boss of the US banking regulator admitted that he learned from the crisis that banks could not be trusted to regulate themselves Even if our financial sector had been markedly different  we still would have been hit  Germany  for example  has banking sector less than half the size of ours and had deeper recession  And remember  the US followed us in implementing measures to control the crisis  The lesson to be learned  Financial regulation matters  Yet going into the crisis the Tories were pushing us to deregulate further  know  was the banking minister at the time Labour also needs to be clear that spending in the run up to the recession was not profligate  Of course it could have been lower  we were running budget deficit of around  at the time  But we run surpluses in previous years  and we had commitments in the  budget to bring the deficit down  in an environment where the consensus was that the economy would keep growing  But let be clear  even if we had run surplus in those years  it would not have made marked difference to the financial tsunami that then hit the UK and other countries  The effect of the financial crisis was far greater than the effect of the deficit Gordon Brown implemented and kept to his golden rules there was no calling in the IMF for usLabour can actually argue the opposite  it is because Brown had implemented and kept to his golden rules in the previous years that our economy responded to the crisis in similar way to the economies of the US  France and Germany  and has been more secure than Ireland  Spain and Greece  No calling in the IMF for us  It wasn the    remember  And the lesson to learn  This type of budget discipline really matters  to keep our economy resilient  The policy response  We should always run surpluses when the economy is growing  Keynesianism in good times as well as bad How Labour explains this to the public is different matter  It must start by accepting what people think  and then using its strategic policy brains to work out how to get out of this hole  But we should not apologise and beg forgiveness for crimes we have not committed  We re is better than that  It just time to do some hard work to prove it

The unions are acting like an overbearing partner Labour shouldn fear divorce,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/labour-cannot-let-unions-decide-next-leader,commentisfree,The Labour MP Jon Cruddas has said that the party must now  go to some dark places  and be brutally honest with itself about why it lost  It doesn have to venture far  the dark places are sinkholes all around it Headlines screaming that evil union bosses are holding the party to ransom can be put down to terrible rightwing media  the usual running down of our sacred trade union history  failure to acknowledge millions of workers or they could be the cold  hard truth As long as the Labour party is dependent on funding from the unions we will have figures like Len McCluskey  with his dreams of Cuba  threatening to withdraw financial support if Labour doesn choose the leader he wants  What McCluskey mandate actually is in deciding these things is open to debate  possibly all Unite members are furiously engaged in discussion about who the  change candidate  is  whatever that means In all the rethinking Labour needs to do  its relationship with the unions is key  Marriage is the metaphor always used  but it is marriage in which the breadwinner slaps the pay packet on the table in return for controlling exactly what happens both inside and outside the house and marriage doesn really work like that any more Trade unions safeguard the rights of ordinary people in the workplace  Where they have modernised they have done so brilliantly  but it cannot be denied that casualisation  outsourcing and the loss of manufacturing mean that they are not the big beast they once were  About quarter of us belong to unions now  marked decline since the late    when half of all workers were unionised  Thatcher of course made concerted attack on union power in the    This continues but there have been glimmers of hope  with slight rise in membership in private sectors such as retail  and real efforts to unionise call centre workers  Nonetheless those most in need of unions are the least likely to join them the young and thus we have union membership that is ageing  This isn surprising when so much union activity is conducted in vocabulary that belongs to another era The influence of the unions on Labour leadership is not just about money but also the actual delivery of democracy within the party itself  which remains archaic as well  The relationship is economically determined of course  the Tories are bankrolled by business  bankers and billionaires and Labour out of the wages of  ordinary people  but often those ordinary people do not choose or understand exactly what their affiliation with the party is There are real worries that without keeping union leaders on board the Labour party will not even be able to fund the next general election  This is more than an existential crisis or tedious argument between old and New Labour  it is crisis of democracy within and without the party  It goes to the core of what Labour means now Ernest Bevin remarked in  that Labour  grew out of the bowels of the trade union movement If it now has any stomach left it will call McCluskey bluff  It cannot hold this marriage of the unions and Labour together forever for the sake of the children  The children fled the nest long time ago

Antibiotic resistance is growing menace we must act before it too late,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/antibiotic-resistance-growing-menace-action-needed,commentisfree,In early   Albert Alexander   year old policeman from Oxfordshire  scratched the side of his mouth while pruning roses  This seemingly trivial wound led to life threatening bacterial infection a not uncommon occurrence in the pre antibiotic era with abscesses affecting his eyes  face  and lungs  Alexander case came to the attention of Howard Florey  who  with colleagues at Oxford University  was advancing Alexander Fleming    discovery of the bacteria killing powers of penicillium mould by trying to purify large quantities of the active compound  named penicillin  Alexander condition improved dramatically after intravenous treatment with penicillin  but supplies of the drug soon ran out and month later he died  Seventy four years on  and  after an era when miraculous cures became the norm  we are again running out of effective antibiotics Profligate use of antibiotics has provided the evolutionary driver for bacteria to develop resistance to the drugs  Introduction of every new class of antibiotics has been followed by bacteria becoming resistant  something Fleming warned of for penicillin in his  Nobel prize lecture For the first  years or so of the antibiotics era  doctors compensated for the failing of one antibiotic by using another  newly developed  drug  However  since that golden era  the stream of new antibiotics has turned to trickle as pharmaceutical companies realised greater returns on investment by developing drugs for lifelong diseases rather than acute illnesses such as infected cuts or pneumonia  Indeed  the last entirely new class of antibiotics to reach the market was discovered nearly  years ago  Ways to boost the research and development pipeline for new antibiotics are the focus of the latest report  released last week  from the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance  AMR chaired by economist Jim Neill The AMR review was announced by David Cameron in July   and will produce its definitive recommendations in the summer of next year  The latest paper suggests ways to revitalise the research and development pipeline to produce about  new licensed antibiotics every  years  First  Neill proposes global innovation fund of bn over five years to boost research into new drugs and diagnostic tests  with most of the money going to universities and small biotechnology companies  The big pharmaceutical companies would be asked to make substantial contributions to the fund For too long research into new antibiotics has been chronically underfunded  Take  for example  the   bn research spending from the US National Institutes of Health for    of which just   bn was for AMR research  compared with  bn for cancer and  bn for HIV Aids  This underfunding was highlighted by Ellis Bragginton and Laura Piddock from Birmingham University  who found that of almost  bn research funding for bacteriology in the UK from  to   just     was awarded for work on new antibiotics  As Professor Piddock has pointed out  with such scarcity of funding  research teams tend to compete against each other rather than collaborate  If anything  Neill proposed bn fund seems rather conservative given the amount of catching up that needs to be done The report recommends payments of   bn to companies that create proven new antibioticsThe report also recommends payments of   bn to companies that create proven new antibiotics  The rationale here is that it can take up to  years for pharmaceutical companies to see profit on billion dollar investments in new antibiotics  by guaranteeing payments for drugs that meet pre specified criteria  return on investment would be realised sooner  and the company would not have to push for large volumes of sales reducing the chances of early development of resistance  This scheme would cost   bn over  years  with the money coming from new global purchasing and supply body financed by national governments  The sums involved seem huge  but pale by comparison with the  bn that AMR is estimated to cost in the US every year  or the  bn per year currently spent worldwide on antibiotics The proposal for guaranteed market for new antibiotics builds sensibly on previous experience with global drug funding initiatives such as the Medicines for Malaria Venture  the Gavi alliance  which has revitalised the worldwide availability of vaccines and the TB Alliance  However  progress can be glacially slow  attended the kick off meeting of the TB Alliance in Cape Town early in   when the target of licensing one new antibiotic to treat tuberculosis within five years was set  in reality  that target was not achieved for  years AMR will contribute to  million annual deaths worldwide by   more even than cancer  By boosting the antibiotic pipeline one of several measures needed to combat this crisis we can start to take our fate into our own hands  otherwise  within our lifetimes  we will all know an Albert Alexander

network  acting to stop misleading marketing by the baby feeding industry and to  protect breastfeeding and babies fed on formula to prevent unnecessary death and suffering Brady said the Guardian had conflict of interest in that it was taking sponsorship from company that broke international marketing rules for baby milk formulas  The Guardian claims to retain its journalistic independence  but this case demonstrates the risk of inherent bias  There is clear conflict of interest in having Danone sponsor an event on nutrition in the first   days from conception   The article promoted the company objectives by suggesting nutrition for successful breastfeeding is complex and not well understood  that complementary foods should be introduced earlier than Department of Health recommendations and that  collaboration between government and the food industry  was necessary to educate parents and parents to be   it fits with its business objectives of diverting criticism of marketing practices that violate national and international rules and portraying itself as source of nutrition information  The Guardian Roundtable began life in the now defunct Public magazine  which was launched for public sector managers in   It was subsumed into the Guardian Society section when the magazine moved online   In the early days of the feature at least half of the sponsorships came from public bodies but that area of sponsorship dried up in  For many years there have also been Society and Education roundtables on wide range of topics  Those features  commissioned and produced by Guardian Creative  now the Studio  were published in the  supplements  They only moved to the main paper when the s closed There were more than  roundtables sold last year and they cover business and global development topics as well as education and society  Would be sponsors can suggest subject but don control the title of the debate  the guest list or the copy  which is written by journalist separate to the chair of the debate  also journalist This is the only complaint of its kind  although there have been consistent complaints that the panels should be more diverse  which organisers accept and are trying to change On this occasion the guest list included critic who refused to attend but who contacted Baby Milk Action  Brady said he wrote to the Guardian before the conference took place to complain of the Danone sponsorship but received no reply He also makes broader point Baby Milk Action is concerned about the business model the Guardian has introduced of sponsored content  sections and debates  The benefits to the sponsor are clear  an opportunity to shape discussion of topic to its own agenda  the kudos of being associated with leading paper such as the Guardian  and an opportunity to divert attention from negative business practices   At the very least  the Guardian must strengthen its conflicts of interest safeguards for any sponsored content or events  When it hears from invitees that there is conflict of interest with its chosen sponsor  why not listen to their concerns rather than pressing on regardless  He says the benefits for the reader are less clear but colleagues who work within the commercial professional networks argue that sponsors want to be associated with being part of the debate  not to sell things There is no point beating around the bush  Serious journalism is time consuming and expensive if it is done properly and commercial colleagues are under great deal of pressure to find income at time when all newspapers are suffering from falling advertising and circulation revenues I think it is naive to imagine that any company would sponsor content unless it was in the company interest  However  is that an interest that is compatible with the readers I am not against sponsored content providing it is clearly labelled for the reader roundtables are and it is interesting for the reader  But each deal should be decided on case by case basis looking at every aspect of company record and stated intentions Baby milk is the hottest of hot topics  The anti baby milk campaign  initially anti Nestle  but now anti all of them  has been going on for decades  so trouble on this issue was inevitable  The campaigners are highly critical of scientists funded by the formula milk industry and fight pitched battles at the World Health Organisation  which stated as far back as  that babies should be breastfed until the age of six months According to Baby Milk Action  Danone has breached Advertising Standards Authority guidelines on six occasions in the past five years and it has been widely criticised in the press for the way it markets follow on milk that may be given to baby from six months  by which time most are weaned Zoe Williams reported from Jakarta  Indonesia  in the Guardian on  February  on the way in which Sari Husada  subsidiary of Danone  built up relationships with midwives  which led to increased sales of baby milk formulas  Danone denied there was any connection with giving gifts to the midwives and the sales of formulas While this issue is about Guardian processes  summarised the concerns of the readers to Danone  asked spokeswoman what it hoped to achieve by sponsoring the roundtable  She said We are passionate about the importance of nutrition in the first   days  of child life  and take our responsibility as one of the UK largest manufacturers for this age group seriously  We have long history of proactively engaging on early life nutrition policy issues  With general election this year  the roundtable offered timely opportunity to consolidate views on the last government achievements on early life nutrition and to highlight recommendations to its successor as part of shared goal to make early life nutrition public health priority  We are genuinely interested in the future health of UK children  this was not an opportunity to promote infant formula  We didn and wouldn talk about our products at the roundtable  The feeding choices that parents make were discussed by the participants as part of wider conversation but we don  own  the conversation or try to control it  Promoting infant formula or our products in this way is against our own strict internal governance procedures and UK legal requirements  We chose to sponsor Guardian roundtable because this forum ensures that issues are talked over in depth from different angles through process which is transparent and independent of the sponsor  It brings together experts who may not have previously engaged with one another and welcomes the opportunity to debate opposing views  with an independent editorial write up post event  The Guardian network approach enables targeted and engaged audience to be reached  The wider issues of sponsored content has led to the setting up of sponsorship governance group at the Guardian  weekly meeting of editorial and commercial managers who discuss ethical considerations and any potential conflicts of interest The Danone sponsorship should have gone to that group  fact now accepted by the editors who were involved with the roundtables  agree with the readers and think it was mistake to go ahead with the Danone sponsorship because the subject of the debate could be interpreted as being too close to the subject of the controversy that has surrounded the company 
You might not think you re sexist until you take look at your bookshelf,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/you-might-not-think-youre-a-sexist-until-you-take-a-look-at-your-bookshelf,commentisfree,Director and screenwriter John Waters once said If you go home with somebody  and they don have books  don fuck  em Wise words  but d add  Especially if they don have books by women When you live in world with outrageous  explicit misogyny domestic violence  sexual assault and attacks on reproductive rights  to name few it easy to breeze by the small stuff  After all  there are issues more pressing than whether or not the culture someone consumes is too homogenous But passive bias is still bias and it has ripple effects into the broader culture  Is it really so much to ask that we pay attention to what shapes our tastes For example  was riding the subway recently when noticed my seatmate scrolling through Twitter feed that looked remarkably like mine  was tickled to be sitting next to like minded person  but as looked on noticed there was one thing that seemed to be missing from his newsfeed  women  He was following fantastic and smart men  but still as far as could tell  all men I got the same uneasy feeling when listened to podcast interview with TV showrunner and writer that admire  He spoke eloquently about his passions and mentors and the people whose work he liked most  All men I sure both of these people are smart  engaged and not deliberately or actively sexist but when your worldview is solely shaped by men  you are missing out  And like it or not  your taste in music  books  television or art says something about you  it sends message about what you think is worth your time  what you think is interesting and who you think is smart  So if the only culture you pay attention to is created by men  or created by white people  you are making an explicit statement about who and what is important Part of the problem is that while art or books that white men put out is portrayed as universally appealing  culture produced by women or people of color is seen as specific to their gender or racial identity When author Shannon Hale visited an elementary school to talk about her work  for example  she realized that the audience was all girls  the school administration only allowed the female students out of class for her event  As Hale wrote at the time I do not talk about  girl  stuff   talk about books and writing  reading  rejections and moving through them  how to come up with story ideas  But because m woman  because some of my books have pictures of girls on the cover  because some of my books have  princess  in the title  m stamped as  for girls only However  the male writers who have boys on their covers speak to the entire school  This kind of passive sexism has wide reaching impact the annual VIDA count  which tallies the racial and gender diversities in magazines and newspaper bylines and books reviewed  for example  shows we still have long way to go for equity in cultural representation Part of that challenge is not just about what kind of culture we consume but what we put out into the world as well  Last year  technologist Anil Dash  for example  wrote about new years resolution to only retweet women he came to the idea after realizing that even though he followed men and women equally  he retweeted men three times as often as women  This  despite my knowing how underrepresented women voices are in the areas obsess over  such as technology and policy and culture  could do better  We all could Yes  our tastes are our tastes I not suggesting you put away all books written by men or only listen to female musicians  well  not yet anyway But our cultural biases as unintentional as they may be are worth thinking about  Not just to address broad inequalities  but to open up our own minds 
George Osborne  northern powerhouse  project will devastate whole cities,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/northern-powerhouse-cities-devolution-england-manchester-george-osborne,commentisfree,In October   the Economist suggested that  rather than third tier cities such as Hull  Huddersfield and Wolverhampton continuing to be subsidised  they should be allowed to decline  Rather than creating  enterprise zones ploughing pupil premiums into decaying schools or investing in infrastructure projects  the government should support the people who want to find jobs elsewhere  most likely at the fringes of the big cities already emerging from the recession This was not the story that was being presented at last week launch of chancellor George Osborne  northern powerhouse  project  but it is difficult not to see it as the inevitable conclusion of this new drive to revive and renew the north  Undoubtedly there will be those who benefit from this devolution of powers to individual cities unlocking hidden potential and new wealth  But it will also widen the gaps between those who can jump on the bandwagon  and those who can  This metropolitan revolution will further starve those secondary cities and towns most affected by the long decline of industry and the recession Some may find it baffling that the Tories would hand power away from Westminster to cities that only last week committed themselves to Labour but it makes certain sense  The general election made clear the stark contrast between an urban red and rural blue as much as it highlighted nationalist divisions  Either way  everyone can agree that London is too powerful  Yet the problem is not that London is too big  but that the other cities starved of resources since the centralising s are too small  Devolution must act as pull  rather than push The northern powerhouse idea is part of wider urban change that can be seen to be influencing policy across the major nations  It follows the philosophy promoted by the US academic Benjamin Barber and the Brookings Institute Bruce Katz that national government has had its day  and mayor  at city level  is best placed to react to the situation on the ground  providing the local politics needed to get things done  The future is urban  and cities are doing it for themselves  These ideas are good for boosting those cities that can connect themselves to the global economic network  it offers nothing for those that can Thus  Greater Manchester looks set to prosper  In exchange for fiscal powers  the city will take control of transport  and other public services policing  skills  housing  enterprise zones  From February  the city took control of its bn health budget  According to the Core Cities group that includes Manchester  Birmingham  Bristol  Cardiff  Glasgow  Leeds and Liverpool  this process of devolution could deliver an additional   bn and  jobs the equivalent of the total economy of Denmark This is going to happen  Already minister  James Wharton  has been named to take charge of the northern powerhouse initiative  while Jim Neill  the Goldman Sachs economist who ran the city growth commission at the RSA last year  has been awarded the role of commercial secretary to the Treasury  sincerely hope that they can get this right  level of metropolitan devolution is not just good idea but an inevitable one  cities need to have control over how they grow both economically and as places planning the future  developing skills and enterprise But we cannot ignore the context in which these powers are being redistributed  The election results gave the government ringing endorsement for austerity and free hand to apply deeper cuts  Devolution is not just the opportunity to localise economic growth  but also to parcel out the pain  So  what else is going on here The north is not one place it is an uneven territory within its own boundariesDevolution will make London and the south east stronger and even richer  The Tories have long been convinced that the capital subsidises the rest of the country  in  it was estimated that  in every  earned in London was spent outside of the city  The truth is more complicated there are more public works in London and the south east than anywhere else but the impression remains that bankers  taxes pay for Benefits Street  Devolution reduces this flow northward  as each city has to find its own revenue Second  it will break up the last remnants of the national welfare state  This will shatter the NHS into local hubs  each with its own budget and administration  Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham was quick to see this as another form of privatisation  Similarly schools and skills are being handed to an increasingly commercialised local regime  Do we expect these groups to work in harmony or to become competitive over decreasing resources  What if the city cannot afford to pay its bills  How does city borrow to fund large scale projects  such as housing Osborne rose tinted image shows the development of an urban mega region  the agglomeration of metropolitan centres linked together by large public infrastructural projects  This will allow one to live in Leeds but be at meeting in Manchester in  minutes  Last year Jim Neill suggested way of creating  Manpool  out of the two major cities of the north west  and  Sunderpool  for the north east  But it will take more than rail track to unite the north  Yorkshire already has much to say about the prioritising of Manchester as the nominal capital of the north And what of those places that will need bit more help to enjoy the benefits of this metropolitan revolution  The north is not one place  seen only in contrast to the south  It is an uneven territory within its own boundaries  There will be winners in this new era but there will also be plenty of losers  communities that are still struggling in the face of wanton austerity and bleak economic outlook  These are often places with compounded problems of skills shortage  health deficit and lack of jobs  For cities and towns like this  becoming part of the  northern powerhouse  might just make things tougher and even spell their extinction 
The Labour leadership hopefuls represent spadocracy where the vision ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/labour-party-leadership-race-spadocracy-special-advisers,commentisfree,The candidates for the Labour leadership are coming forward  And two things are clear  The first is that they are all former special advisers  or spads  The only exception to this is Mary Creagh  And she was the leader of the Labour group on Islington council  which some people might say is the next best thing What also remarkable is that they all come from one wing of the Labour party  Not single one of the current candidates opposed the Iraq war  not single one supports taking back the railways into public ownership  not single one opposes  austerity lite  and not single one opposes the welfare cap  In other words  the views of millions of Labour supporters and the majority of Scottish Labour supporters will not be represented in the ongoing leadership debate Some of my best friends are spads  But it may be that they are just not suited to leadership  Spads are great at schmoozing and PR  Some may even be good at policy  But it rare that at any time in their career they will need to have vision  Because that their bosses  job  So it understandable that Labour party that has for years been run by cabal of ex spads a  spadocracy  perhaps had no vision  And we are now entering leadership battle where whole range of ideas is excluded The premise is that  red Ed  was too  leftwing But   year off your energy bills  although desirable  is not recipe for socialist utopia  Miliband was nice man  who had some signature policies that could be framed as leftwing  but the whole was definitely less than the sum of its parts  In particular  he failed to challenge austerity This is why we have people such as Lindsey Garrett of Hackney New Era estate talking about standing for mayor of London  met Garrett and her fellow tenants at the beginning of their campaigning  and they were inspiring  New Era tenants  with almost no power  fearlessly led battle against huge international property investor and won  And in launching her mayoral bid  Garrett has put together vision for the London in which she wants her daughter to grow up I want to live in the London of Garrett vision  But want the Labour party to be leading the charge to achieve it  One of the policies in her manifesto a landlord tax to pay for social housing I even worked on with the campaign group Generation Rent I want Labour party that people like Garrett feel they can join and support  where people like Garrett could become MPs and ministers and maybe even leader  But we don have that party  Instead we have that spadocracy  crowding out vision with fetish instead for triangulation If we don have debate involving all strands of opinion in the party  we may never again deserve to winThe current Labour leadership candidates are all very nice people  But they now openly say that they think party members are wrong on most things  They say that our language and policies must focus on middle England  whoever and whatever that is  And they talk about  aspiration  without recognising that George Osborne austerity will crush aspiration for whole generation The current crop of Labour leadership candidates also seem to believe that we lost Scotland because voters succumbed inexplicably to mystical nationalism  The roots of our electoral collapse in Scotland predate Miliband leadership  But we compounded matters by going into the last election with pro austerity economic policy only to be soundly beaten by the anti austerity SNP  And in Scotland  except on the rare occasions when Gordon Brown erupted into the debate  we did not offer vision London mayoral selection is currently overshadowed by the leadership election  But they are part of the same debate  And there are lessons to be learned from Scotland about fighting to win London in   If we make the same mistake in London as in Scotland if we refuse to offer vision of city that Londoners want to live in then we will lose  And if we are dishonest  if we try to offer vision for London while at the same time contradicting it with our national agenda  then we will also lose I don want to lose  want to be Labour mayor of London  want Labour party with vision  Labour party that inspires  and Labour party that can win again  But if we allow the spadocracy to strengthen its hold on the party unchallenged  and if we don have debate involving all strands of opinion in the party  we may never again deserve to win in London or anywhere else 
The Human Rights Act spells peril for Cameron,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/human-rights-act-david-cameron-runnymede-tories-slim-majority,commentisfree,Meet the  Runnymede Tories The most prominent of their number  David Davis  likes the label  so it might just stick  shorthand for those Conservatives compelled by strong belief in civil liberties and the tradition of ancestral freedoms  enshrined in Magna Carta on the meadowed banks of the Thames eight centuries ago As an animating force  this conviction is more than the heritage loving sentimentalism to which some Tories are indeed prone  In fact  it may be responsible for some of the new government most perilous moments in parliament  For party that needed the Liberal Democrats to govern in its first term  to win  seat majority was historic achievement  But the scale of that achievement does not alter the brute fact   is only  I have long urged the Cameron camp to make its peace with Davis  who was raised by single mother on council estate  is an experienced businessman and personifies the  blue collar conservatism  that the prime minister now endorses  But Davis has not been forgiven by the Tory leadership for resigning his seat in June   over Labour plan to extend the maximum period of detention of terror suspects without charge from  to  days  Seven years on  he fully expects to be at the heart of one of this government first significant defeats To set the scene  Michael Gove  the new justice secretary  has been tasked with fulfilling the Tory manifesto pledge to  scrap the Human Rights Act  and introduce British bill of rights Once enacted  the bill  will break the formal link between British courts and the European court of human rights  and make our own supreme court the ultimate arbiter of human rights matters in the UK  Runnymede Tories believe that Blair and his successors have exploited the fear generated by terrorism to curtail rightsRunnymede Tories such as Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke  both QCs  are not like the Eurosceptic  bastards  who made John Major life living hell  They do not operate as cohesive gang or whipped party within party not yet  anyway  Some  such as Jesse Norman  the Tory MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire  want to keep the Human Rights Act  Others are content for it to be replaced by British bill of rights provided the bill is sufficiently robust as bulwark against the over mighty state  Meanwhile  Dominic Raab  MP for Esher and Walton  Davis former chief of staff and author of the Runnymede Tories  founding tract  The Assault on Liberty   has been made justice minister  Has he been bought off by Big Brother  or do the Tory civil libertarians now have man on the inside All parties are always  to greater or lesser degree  split  often around many axes  For decades  the Conservatives were divided into  wets  and  dries then  Eurosceptics  and  Europhiles then socially liberal  mods  and morally upright  rockers These bifurcations persist  But the argument that is most intriguing and most fissile today is between the Runnymede Tories and those Conservatives who dislike the human rights industry  or the specifically European variety  or intellectual abstractions in general  The left are natural dialecticians  Most Tories think  dialecticians  are the people you phone when the fuses blow Why has significant minority of Conservatives become exercised by the risk to civil liberties  and why now  This generation of Conservative parliamentarians was shaped by New Labour  not the cold war  They watched Tony Blair and Gordon Brown regulate  intrude and nurture the nanny state  often in collaboration with Brussels  They fretted as political ambition was given rocket boosters by technology  The new gods were digital  omniscient  swooping through the stratosphere  recording anyone and anything they chose  In the end  Big Brother had come not in the form of  boot stamping on human face  but in gigabytes of data unwittingly given by the citizen Related to this is the profound schism within Conservative ranks over the western response to  and subsequent jihadi attacks  When Blair said after the   atrocities that  the rules of the game have changed many Tories agreed  there are shy neo cons too  you know Gove was their natural tribune  In his book Celsius   he wrote  correctly  in my view  When senior law lord such as Leonard Hoffmann can say of attempts to restrain the liberty of Islamist ideologues that  the real threat to the life of the nation comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these then we know we are living in land that has still not woken up to the challenge we face  Runnymede Tories  in contrast  believe that Blair and his successors have exploited the fear generated by terrorism to curtail rights and augment state power  For them  human rights are both profoundly precious and profoundly British  In   after all  Britain became the first country to ratify the European convention a text that had been heralded by Churchill and  mostly  drafted by the former Conservative attorney general David Maxwell Fyfe  For Conservatives of this stripe  the convention roots  furthermore  lie in the common law of this country and what Burke called the  recorded  rights etched into countless judgments of English courts  They are to be found in the  bill of rights  in Blackstone  and in the work of more recent jurists such as AV Dicey There are serious practical barriers to the scrapping of the Human Rights Act  not least the extent to which it is embedded in devolution legislation and the Good Friday agreement  But the technical aspects of the problem are the least of it  folk memory of Magna Carta has been awoken that will not galvanise every Tory MP but is strong enough to give the government whips Magna Hemicrania  look it up  As wrote last week  if anyone has the intellectual firepower to square all the circles it is Gove  He will also need political guile  and confidence that David Cameron will stand by him when things get sticky  which they will  Unfortunately  the justice secretary cannot take this for granted  The manner in which Gove was moved from the Department for Education for doing precisely what he had been tasked to do is one of the worst blemishes on Cameron record This is precisely the sort of issue that might unite the opposition parties so that every single Conservative vote will count  As things stand  the Runnymede Tories would defeat any bid to ditch the Human Rights Act with support to spare  That life with small majority for you  Welcome back to reality  prime minister 
PNG   years after independence  can be more than quarry,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/png-40-years-after-independence-can-be-more-than-a-quarry,commentisfree,After years of uncertainty  the once profitable copper mine on Bougainville  an autonomous province of Papua New Guinea  PNG could well be reopened The chairman of Bougainville Copper Limited  BCL Peter Taylor  told the Australian recently that  the Bougainville government seems to want the mine reopened  but we have to sit down   and see what doable  BCL Panguna mine opened in   three years before PNG was granted independence from Australia  Bougainvilleans barely benefited from the operation  deal that smacked of colonial arrogance and resulted in pollution In response  locals launched rebellion in the   against the mine  BCL  and the PNG and Australian governments  The resistance won the ensuing civil war but at steep human cost  up to    killed and infrastructure broken Today Bougainville is beset by poverty and economic stagnation  witnessed this myself during two visits in recent years The polls opened last week to elect new government in the lead up to an independence referendum scheduled before   The local government  along with BCL and Canberra  is pushing for the mine to be Bougainville financial saviour  first But according to Jubilee Australia report last year  the vast majority on the island oppose BCL return  This tallies with what heard in towns and villages The potential reopening of the mine is one piece of an Australian strategy to open up South Pacific nations to foreign interests  As Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop said in   Australia should  stimulate the  PNG  private sector through growth  The situation in Bougainville perfectly encapsulates the parlous state of affairs in PNG as it approaches the  year anniversary of its break with Australia On  September  a ceremony was held in the PNG capital Port Moresby  at which Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam  Prince Charles and PNG first prime minister  Michael Somare  declared PNG constitutional monarchy with membership of the Commonwealth The country was was granted independence but its path has been torturous ever since  Canberra never allowed its northern neighbour to fully leave relationship of dependency  and today provides   annually in aid that primarily benefits Australian companies making money there The PNG exposed blog an independent and reliable news and analysis website has criticised Australia attempts to teach PNG leaders how to avoid corruption According to the blog  Canberra turns blind eye to billions of dollars of  PNG taxpayers money  siphoned  through Australian banks and into real estate schemes in Brisbane and Cairns  posh Australian public schools  its glitzy casinos and expensive private hospitals  Forty years after breaking free from Australia  PNG suffers shockingly high levels of HIV infection  maternal health issues  domestic violence  aggression against women and illiteracy  Even the PNG government itself admits that  PNG adult literacy situation is in dire straits  This isn solely Australia fault  endemic corruption has blighted PNG for decades  US State Department cables released by Wikileaks confirm this Yet Western donors and resource companies are principally to blame for engaging in neo colonialism  treating the country as nothing more than source of wealth for outsiders Some of the mining projects currently in operation may be familiar  Ok Tedi  Porgera  Lihir  Ramu  They re all environmentally destructive and offer little benefit to local communities  At the Porgera gold mine  cases of  extreme sexual violence  by security guards against tribal women and girls resulted in offers of compensation It unsurprising that most Papua New Guineans met were sceptical about foreign investment in their country  knowing they would never feel or see any benefit from it Others are more hopeful  like US Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton  During her time as US Secretary of State  she was open in admitting that the huge energy resources in PNG  especially the Exxon Mobil LNG gas pipeline that opened in  and is already struggling due to collapsing global commodity prices  was part of regional contest with China  She chastised China for  wining and dining  Asia Pacific politicians  If anybody thinks that our retreating on these issues is somehow going to be irrelevant to the maintenance of our leadership in world where we are competing with China  that is mistaken notion she said The people of PNG have only been impoverished by so called leadership from Washington and Canberra  Meanwhile  corruption is rife  PNG anti corruption agency  Taskforce Sweep  was starved of funds earlier this year following allegations they made against prime minister Peter Neill Perhaps the clearest indication of how Australia views PNG is the Manus Island asylum seeker deal  Slammed by leading PNG provincial governor as  neo colonialist locals receive little benefit and are really helping the Australian Liberal and Labor parties solve domestic political problem Journalist Jo Chandler  writing recently in the Monthly  shows in great detail the way  Australia is primarily concerned with building the infrastructure to service their interests and comforts This is also an accurate summary of the dynamic between Port Moresby and Canberra since  There huge potential in PNG to be nation that isn known internationally for mining and witch burning  Grassroots groups  such as the Madang based Bismarck Ramu Group  aim to protect local communities and inform them of viable alternatives to resource extraction such as agriculture Yet this year   th anniversary of independence should be sombre occasion to reflect on four decades of failed Australian interference in PNG  Canberra views Port Moresby as overseeing massive quarry Australian firms have the right to plunder  We dump asylum seekers on PNG territory while still claiming to be victim of unscrupulous people smugglers  And our aid money  It is an insurance policy against failed state on Australia

Julia Gillard  the UN new education goal is ambitious and audacious  It has to be,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/julia-gillard-the-uns-new-education-goal-is-ambitious-and-audacious-it-has-to-be,commentisfree,I will be in Korea this week for the most important meeting on education in generation   is year of decision for the future of our children  The World Education Forum in Incheon near Seoul will lay the foundations for achieving an ambitious vision for education and for humanity over the next  years one in which all children  regardless of circumstance  will realise their fundamental right to learn More than   ministers from the developed and developing world will attend in addition to heads of bilateral agencies  officials of multilateral and bilateral organisations  and representatives of civil society  the teaching profession  youth and the private sector  We will work on framework for action on education that will guide the achievement of the United Nation sustainable development goals  SDG  which will be agreed later this year The new education goal to be announced at the UN in New York in September  is true and right Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life long learning opportunities for all It is considerably more ambitious than the education related millennium development goal now  years old which aimed to provide universal primary education with no mention of early childhood or secondary education  or of the critical importance of education quality This World Education Forum will conclude with an important political declaration committing to an education agenda that is ambitious and aspirational  promise that the world will leave no child behind So   is year for decisions to get education right for the decades to come With   million children of primary and lower secondary school age still out of school today and hundreds of millions of other children failing to learn the basics of numeracy and literacy  the SDG education agenda might sound more than little ambitious  Some might even call it audacious But audacity is exactly what we need to take on challenges like these  including the need to support children and young people who lose out on education because of conflict  instability or humanitarian crises such as Ebola or the recent earthquakes in Nepal We the international community need to set ambitious goals and dare ourselves to take the bold steps necessary to achieve them by  One bold step hard but unavoidable is finding the money necessary to enable our goals to be realised The case for investment is clear  Education equals economic growth  No country is more emblematic of that than the Republic of Korea  where we are meeting this week  Its dynamic economy  built out of the ruins of war  is powered by amazing education achievement The recent OECD report  Universal Basic Skills  What Countries Stand to Gain  clearly lays out the economic case  Investing in better quality education outcomes especially in maths and science more than pays for itself  Education net economic benefits are greater than many other investments Yet as global community  we underinvest in education  In its annual Global Monitoring Report  Unesco estimates that to achieve quality pre primary  primary and lower secondary education for all children by    bn more annually needs to be committed to education We cannot close this huge resource gap without dramatically increasing external financing for education from all sources A second bold step once again hard but unavoidable is to ensure that every dollar spent works to maximum effect  This requires rigour in sharing best practice  leveraging knowledge and undertaking inclusive planning as well as the courage to embrace new ways of thinking and working At the Global Partnership for Education  which has already matured into an effective platform to leverage financing  technical expertise and advocacy for improved education sector planning that will strengthen education systems over time  we are determined to keep striving for better and better outcomes We are equally determined to unlock the full power of our partnership with civil society organisations  teachers  bilateral and multilateral donors  the private sector and foundations to support developing country governments  We will continue to encourage all partners to align their financing to national education sector plans which makes education funding more coordinated  transparent and effective But the financing challenge remains even as we build ever greater capacity  We all need to act but to do so in partnership  not alone  Developing countries need to commit additional resources and have the political will to improve education  Signs are encouraging and much of the progress in education over the past  years has occurred precisely because developing countries are stepping up At the Global Partnership for Education Replenishment Conference in Brussels  we saw the power of partnership on display with  developing countries collectively pledging to increase their domestic financing for education by an extraordinary  bn between  and  and donors pledging   bn over the same period  For the first time  private philanthropy leaned in and pledged money direct to the Global Partnership for Education Of course we are grateful for these pledges  But we should all be restless to do more for the

Most of the world workers have insecure jobs  ILO report reveals,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/19/most-of-the-worlds-workers-have-insecure-jobs-ilo-report-reveals,business,A global shift to more insecure jobs since the financial crisis is fuelling growing inequality and higher rates of poverty  according to new report that estimates only quarter of the world workers are on permanent contracts The International Labour Organization  ILO  said the remaining three quarters are employed on temporary or short term contracts  working informally often without any contract  are self employed or are in unpaid family jobs A worldwide trend away from secure jobs risked  perpetuating vicious circle of weak global demand and slow job creation  that has dogged many countries since the crisis  the UN agency said In its World Employment and Social Outlook   WESO the agency highlighted rise in part time employment  especially among young women  Though some workers welcome the flexibility of part time jobs and self employment  often such roles are down to lack of choice  it said  In some cases  non standard forms of work can help people get foothold into the job market  But these emerging trends are also reflection of the widespread insecurity that affecting many workers worldwide today said ILO director general Guy Ryder  The shift we re seeing from the traditional employment relationship to more non standard forms of employment is in many cases associated with the rise in inequality and poverty rates in many countries added Ryder  What more  these trends risk perpetuating the vicious circle of weak global demand and slow job creation that has characterised the global economy and many labour markets throughout the post crisis period  The report found that the number of people on wage and salaried work as opposed to forms of work such as self employment or without contracts was growing worldwide but less than half  or  of those were on permanent contract Workers on wages or salaries still accounted for only half of global employment  with wide variations across regions The report main author  Raymond Torres  noted that in developing countries wage and salaried work was growing at slower pace than before the crisis  while in advanced economies such jobs were not growing and weredeclining in some cases such as in the UK There were signs of declining employment security in high income countries since the financial crisis  Torres said  flagging up the rise of self employment  of workers without contracts and those who were involuntarily working part time  The remuneration of people on these types of contract tends to be less added Torres  director of the ILO research department The report drew link between widespread insecurity at work and rising income inequality in many countries The income gap between permanent and non permanent workers has increased over the past decade it said The ILO is urging policymakers to consider extending social protection such as pensions and unemployment benefit to workers in less secure forms of employment  It said that globally only   of the self employed were part of pension scheme  compared with   of employees Torres cited Chile  China and Brazil as examples of countries that were moving towards great social protection for the self employed and said the evidence suggested such policies did not harm employment rates  Some people have said by moving in this direction to social protection or more regulations you have fewer jobs but that not the case he said The ILO also highlighted comparatively slower recovery in female unemployment rates since  in many regions  including the European Union The report found that the rise in the number of part time jobs outpaced gains in full time jobs between  and  in the vast majority of countries with available information  In France  Italy  Japan  Spain and the European Union more broadly  increases in part time employment occurred alongside losses in full time jobs leading in some instances to overall job losses during this period   Much of the increase in part time employment has been involuntary the report said

Amtrak crash investigators unsure if anything struck train but rule out bullet,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/18/amtrak-crash-investigators-unsure-if-anything-struck-train-but-rule-out-bullet,business,Federal authorities said on Monday they are unsure anything struck the windshield of an Amtrak train minutes before deadly derailment in Philadelphia last week  adding another twist to the investigation the day trains started running to New York again The National Transportation Safety Board said it has not ruled out the possibility an object may have struck the windshield but is uncertain the locomotive was hit at all before the  May derailment  which killed eight people and injured more than   others  Investigators are certain gunshot did not strike the train FBI agents performed forensic work on grapefruit sized fracture on the left side of the Amtrak locomotive windshield  and the NTSB said they found no evidence of any damage that could have been caused by firearm The developments on Monday raised new questions about the events leading up to the derailment  including conversation an assistant conductor told investigators she heard between the Amtrak engineer and regional rail train engineer minutes before the train sped up and went off the rails at curve The assistant conductor said she heard the regional train engineer say he had been  hit by rock or shot at  and she thought she heard the Amtrak engineer say his train had also been struck The NTSB said the regional train engineer recalled no such conversation  and investigators listened to the dispatch tape and heard no communications from the Amtrak engineer to the railroad dispatch centre to say that something had struck the train The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority said it does not know what caused the damage to its train that night Investigators have focused on the acceleration of the Amtrak train as it approached the curve  reaching  mph as it entered   mph stretch and slowing down only slightly before the crash Amtrak engineer Brandon Bostian  among those injured  has told authorities he does not recall anything in the few minutes before the derailment The NTSB said on Monday it could be year before it determines the probable cause of the derailment Amtrak resumed service on Monday with   am southbound train leaving New York City The first northbound train  scheduled to leave Philadelphia at   am  was delayed and pulled out of the th Street Station at   am  About  minutes later  it passed the area where Train   derailed Both trains arrived at their destinations about  minutes behind schedule About  people boarded the New York bound train in Philadelphia  Passenger Christian Milton  of Philadelphia  said it was  great to be back   ve never had any real problems with Amtrak Milton said I ve been travelling it for over  years  There one accident in  years  Something invariably is going to happen somewhere along the lines  m not worried about it  Milton said he would think about the victims and maybe say prayer as the train navigated the curve where the derailment happened Mayor Michael Nutter was on hand to see the train off and hugged the first passenger in line All Acela Express  Northeast Regional and other services also resumed service Amtrak officials said on Sunday that trains along the Northeast Corridor from Washington to Boston would return to service in  complete compliance  with federal safety orders President Barack Obama  landing in Philadelphia before visit to nearby Camden  New Jersey  thanked the city and its rescue workers for their response to the

Station early on Monday  police with dogs flanked the escalator as smattering of passengers showed their tickets to smiling Amtrak agent and headed down to the platform A sign outside the train flashed  All Aboard  in red letters The conductor gave broad all clear wave  stepped inside and the Philadelphia bound train glided out of the station Passenger Raphael Kelly  of New York  looking relaxed  said he was  feeling fine  and had  no worries  Kelly  who takes Amtrak to Philadelphia weekly  said with smile that if he did have any concerns I have to get over it  Tom Carberry  who had been driving  minutes to an hour to take commuter train from Trenton  New Jersey  to New York  praised Amtrak for restoring service so swiftly  My biggest takeaway was the under promise and over deliver and the surprise of having it come back this morning when that wasn expected said Carberry  of Philadelphia That was good thing for Amtrak  An Amtrak spokesman  Craig Schultz  said it was important to restore service  calling the Northeast Corridor  an economic engine here on the east coast  Lawyers for four passengers injured in the derailment announced lawsuits against Amtrak on

UK inflation tipped to turn negative for the first time since   ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/18/uk-inflation-picked-to-turn-negative-for-the-first-time-in-more-than-50-years,business,We have not been here since   economists expect official figures on Tuesday to show annual inflation on the standard CPI measure dipping below zero for the first time in more than  years  pushed lower by nearly  months of low oil prices and ferocious supermarket price wars The CPI index dates back only to   but the ONS has produced comparable records going back to  and estimated when the index hit zero in February that it was at its lowest since  A halt in inflation has helped boost household budgets but the return of deflation is expected to be only momentary  Inflation is tipped to reappear after April with prices rising every month until Christmas and beyond  eventually limiting real income growth and potentially hurting living standards The prospect of an annual dip in overall shop prices comes after last year halving of the oil price  steep decline in raw materials costs  drop in the cost of food and an early Easter holiday The consensus among City banks is for inflation to remain at zero  but Samuel Tombs  UK economist at Capital Economics said the arrival of Easter couple of weeks earlier than last year meant the bumper shopping weekend would not be captured in the monthly figures from the Office for National Statistics  giving an even lower reading for prices and pushing the annual inflation rate below zero Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that inflation could turn negative before an expected pick up towards the end of the year as the effect of oil and food price falls fades  He said he expected the inflation rate to hit its  target in couple of years Fifty years ago the retail prices index plummeted in response to commodity price falls  giving brief respite to British workers familiar with inflationary pressures that were largely absent from the continent and the US  Later in the    after several years of full employment  inflation became entrenched  In the   it reached   before falling back during period of austerity and was only tamed in the   Currently inflationary pressures are once again largely absent across the world  with both the US and eurozone reporting zero inflation rates Tombs said the figure for April would be the best chance of negative figure for UK inflation and was likely to mark the low point  The ONS figures this year will not capture Easter spending in the way they did last year  It a timing effect that means April is the best chance for negative figure  But there won be sudden rise in inflation  It will rise steadily for the rest of the year and into   Tombs expects wages to continue rising this year  maintaining the differential with inflation and protecting real wage growth  He said he expected wage growth to plateau at around  in   severely limiting real terms rises in living standards if price inflation has reached  But several surveys have shown that Britain workers expect employers to block big pay rises  The most recent household survey by financial data provider Markit found that households on average expected no more than  pay rise this year If this forecast is borne out  the rise in household incomes would go into reverse once inflation tops   and some economists expect that threshold to be reached this year Answering questions about the Bank quarterly Inflation Report last week  Carney stressed that temporary period of falling prices should not be mistaken for damaging spiral of  deflation  He said  persistent headwinds  continued to hold back the British economy in the wake of the financial crisis  including weak global demand  the austerity squeeze on government spending and private firms cutting back their debts He reiterated the view of the rate setting monetary policy committee  MPC  that inflation was likely to remain subdued and this would mean more gradual pace of rate rises than in the past  as well as rates remaining  below historical levels for some time to come  Rates would rise to just  by the middle of  according to market expectations  which the Bank said were in line with it meeting its  inflation target Addressing concerns that rising inflation would eat into real wages  Carney said Wages have grown by around  in the past year less than half the average rate before the global financial crisis and the key risk is that these subdued growth rates continue  Guy Foster  head of research at stockbroker Brewin Dolphin said flat or negative inflation would be largely ignored by consumers already seeing higher petrol prices at the pumps  Consumers are noticing that petrol  whilst still cheaper than year ago  is not as cheap as it was in January said He warned that the feelgood factor of the last six months could wane as consumers feel the pinch from higher weekly costsAverage shop prices on the other hand are still falling  In March they slumped  on year earlier  the largest annual fall since records began in  The effect has been marked in food prices with an intense supermarket price war eating into the profits of the major chains Further pressure on wages and rising petrol prices could force the supermarkets to maintain price cuts or reduce the burden on family budgets further

As the UK has discovered  there is no postindustrial promised land,https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/may/18/as-the-uk-has-discovered-there-is-no-postindustrial-promised-land,business,Anyone puzzled by Scotland increasing disaffection should take look at book called British Enterprise  Written by Alexander Howard and Ernest Newman  and published in   the immediate afterglow of the festival of Britain  it consisted of short descriptions of each of more than   then world beating British manufacturing companies It strikingly illustrates how much more geographically balanced the British economy was in those days  In common with latter day Germany  every region of   Britain had plenty of industrial prowess to boast of The Midlands had the British car industry  the world second largest by total output and No in exports  Wales had toys  steel  and domestic appliances  Nottingham had bicycles  Newcastle and Belfast led the world in key areas of heavy engineering  and  of course  Lancashire had cotton Then there was Scotland  Its roll call of exporting titans included Renfrew  based Babcock and Wilcox  which made boilers for the world power stations  Other major Scottish exporters included North British Locomotive and the William Beardmore castings company  In Dundee there was National Cash Register major British subsidiary and in Kirkcaldy the Nairn linoleum company The list went on and on  and at the top was the John Brown company  Although then one of the world most technically advanced manufacturers  John Brown is largely forgotten today  Its products  however  are not  They included the Lusitania  HMS Repulse  the Queen Mary  the Queen Elizabeth  the QE  and others  John Brown was the cornerstone of Clydebank shipbuilding industry that built nearly  third of the world ships All this was before the coming of postindustrialism  superficially attractive but fundamentally disastrous intellectual fad  Espoused by London  based elites in the   and powerfully championed by Margaret Thatcher in the    postindustrialism postulates that sophisticated states no longer need manufacturing  Instead they should promptly move to new promised land of postindustrial services Unfortunately  as the Scots particularly have discovered  there is no promised land  With the exception of Edinburgh  whose financial services industry is the UK second largest  the new postindustrial economy has proved no substitute for advanced manufacturing For Scots  perhaps the most obvious evidence of postindustrialism fallacies is in how the global shipbuilding industry has developed  As the Clydebank shipyards were closing generation ago  Scots were told the industry was migrating to low wage states and nothing could be done about it A generation later  the facts are in  shipbuilding remains predominantly developed world activity and the world leading shipbuilders are based in places such as South Korea  Japan  and Scandinavia states where  for the most part  blue  collar wages are at least as high as in the UK Postindustrialists often suggest their opponents want to return to the    In reality  of course  that world is gone and nothing can restore it  But this in no way diminishes the case for manufacturing  The fact is manufacturing evolves and so do the companies which engage in it TakeToray of Tokyo  humble maker of rayon in the s  it has long since graduated to higher things  These days it is noted mainly as maker of carbon fibre  hi  tech material that is vital in host of applications from tennis rackets to space vehicles  It is  for instance  the key factor in the superlight wings of Boeing    the most fuel  efficient passenger jet in history Similarly  to take another impressive example  Zeiss of Germany has long since expanded far beyond basic photography  These days it is dominant maker of high  precision lenses for key scientific  medical  and industrial applications  This includes so called steppers photo  optical machines that print circuit patterns on semiconductors The manufacture of each new generation of semiconductor requires more precise photo  optics  which in turn means more precisely cut lenses  These latter can be almost as large as car tyre and several of varying sizes are needed in each stepper Advanced manufacturing scores over postindustrial services in three key ways jobs  exports  and wages  The jobs point is self  explanatory  you don need PhD to work on factory floor  As for exports  manufacturing scores in part because at least at the advanced end of the business manufactured products need little tailoring for different foreign markets  This applies in spades in the case of the sort of sophisticated components  advanced materials  and precision machine tools on which the export success of nations such as Japan and Germany is based By contrast  in the computer software industry  for instance  the costs needed to adapt products for different foreign markets are generally incurred abroad and greatly cut into net export receipts Another key point is that advanced manufacturing is generally capital intensive  thus each worker productivity is powerfully leveraged by the machinery he or she is working with  In some cases  the investment per worker may be as much as half million pounds an entry fee so high it guarantees that the only new entrants are in high  wage nations Another plus is that advanced manufacturing involves industrial secrets acquired through years if not generations of learning  by doing  Such secrets are typically known to only few top engineers and cannot easily be reverse  engineered by new entrants to the industry By contrast  services even the most advanced tend to be labour  intensive and require little secret knowhow  Hence the drift of the computer software industry to India and Russia None of this is much of secret in Japan  where have lived most of my adult life  In fact it was in Tokyo bookshop that happened upon that book mentioned  Its previous owner was  imagine  Japanese official or corporate executive who bought it on an information gathering mission to the UK in the early   He and his colleagues did their work well so well that Japan is now leader in virtually every industry that helped define British economic leadership in   Eamonn Fingleton is the author of In Praise of Hard Industries  Why Manufacturing  Not the

McDonald bans media from shareholder meeting amid protest threat,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/18/mcdonalds-bans-media-meeting-shareholders-protest-threat,business,McDonald has been accused of  trying to hide from public scrutiny  by banning the media from this week shareholder meeting  which staff have promised to gatecrash with the biggest ever protest demanding an end to  poverty wages  paid to many of its   staff Shareholders and corporate governance groups said it was  extremely shocking  that company the size of McDonald would try to hold its annual meeting behind closed doors  especially so soon after its new chief executive  Steve Easterbrook  promised to act as an  internal activist  and turn the struggling company into  modern and progressive  burger chain The AFL CIO  the largest federation of US trade unions and holder of more than  worth of McDonald shares  told the Guardian We can think of single other company who has dared to ban the press from an annual meeting  What does the company have to hide   We call on McDonald to reverse their decision and allow the media Vineeta Anand  the AFL CIO chief investment research analyst  said Sunshine is the best disinfectant  when you shine light on company it changes their behaviour  They are acting like some sort of secret society  McDonald is not an insignificant company  they are one of the nation best known household names and it is extremely shocking and troubling that company of its size would ban the press  When the Guardian asked McDonald for permission to report from the meeting at its headquarters in Chicago on Thursday  the newspaper was told its reporters would be prevented from entering We will not be hosting media inside the meeting a McDonald spokeswoman  Heidi Baker  said Media are invited to listen to the meeting via webcast  The company has previously banned media from attending the event  Barker confirmed that Easterbrook was involved in the decision to continue the ban  highly unusual move at major listed company  Easterbrook declined to comment and failed to respond when asked directly on Twitter Barker denied that McDonald was banning the media to try to avoid reporting of the low wage protest  and said it was because  our priority is to accommodate our valued shareholders  However  shareholders contacted by the Guardian said transparency at McDonald was vital and inviting the media would allow more small shareholders to be able to learn about what happened in the meeting  Last year   protesters were arrested and part of McDonald sprawling Chicago campus was forced to close Anand said McDonald suggestion that there would not be room to accommodate the media was  the lamest of lame excuses  How many press were they expecting and how many investors she said If it a question of hundreds of people  maybe they should rent bigger room  and if they can afford that  it is pretty pathetic  Timothy Smith  director of governance and shareholder engagement at Walden Asset Management  which holds  of McDonald shares  said Obviously many companies would like to keep such controversies under wraps  Since McDonald proudly declares it believes it must be accountable to consumers  employees and the public as well as shareholders  it is surprising that they wish to hold their annual meeting in secret without press allowed to observe  Eleanor Bloxham  chief executive of the Value Alliance and Corporate Governance Alliance  which advises many of the Fortune   companies on corporate governance issues  said McDonald ban on the media was  very fearful move   It signals fear of scrutiny  and it not going to help them build trust with shareholders or the public she said They should want people to be able to understand the conversation between McDonald and its workers and shareholders  In terms of rebuilding its reputation and regaining public trust  this goes against everything they have been trying to do  It is very fearful move that is not going to create confidence on behalf of shareholders or the public  Father Seamus Finn  chairman of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility  ICCR a coalition of asset management firms with more than   bn under management  said McDonald exclusion of the press was  deeply disturbing and quite perplexing   At time when the company is struggling to regain its footing on number of fronts and working to attract new customers this is no time to hide from public scrutiny he said This is not the kind of behaviour that would expect to see from any public global corporation that relies on the trust of its customers on daily basis  Adriana Alvarez  McDonald worker who will be protesting outside the meeting on Thursday  said that while she could understand why the company would

Eurozone crisis  EU siege mentality looks likely to squeeze Greece,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/18/greece-crisis-eu-siege-mentality-squeeze-athens,business,Once again  Greece seems to have slipped the financial noose  By drawing on its holdings in an International Monetary Fund reserve account  it was able to repay       ironically to the IMF itself just as the payment was falling due This brinkmanship is no accident  Since coming to power in January  the Greek government  led by the prime minister  Alexis Tsipras Syriza party  has believed that the threat of default and thus of financial crisis that might break up the euro  provides negotiating leverage to offset Greece lack of economic and political power  Months later  Tsipras and his finance minister  Yanis Varoufakis  an academic expert in game theory  still seem committed to this view  despite the lack of any evidence to support it But their calculation is based on false premise  Tsipras and Varoufakis assume that default would force Europe to choose between just two alternatives  expel Greece from the eurozone or offer it unconditional debt relief  But the European authorities have third option in the event of Greek default  Instead of forcing  Grexit the EU could trap Greece inside the eurozone and starve it of money  then simply sit back and watch the Tsipras government domestic political support collapse Such siege strategy waiting for Greece to run out of the money it needs to maintain the normal functions of government now looks like the EU most promising technique to break Greek resistance  It is likely to work because the Greek government finds it increasingly difficult to scrape together enough money to pay wages and pensions at the end of each month To do so  Varoufakis has been resorting to increasingly desperate measures  such as seizing the cash in municipal and hospital bank accounts  The implication is that tax collections have been so badly hit by the economic chaos since January election that government revenues are no longer sufficient to cover day to day costs  If this is true nobody can say for sure because of the unreliability of Greek financial statistics  another of the EU authorities  complaints  the Greek government negotiating strategy is doomed The Tsipras Varoufakis strategy assumed that Greece could credibly threaten to default  because the government  if forced to follow through  would still have more than enough money to pay for wages  pensions  and public services  That was reasonable assumption back in January  The government had budgeted for large primary surplus  which excludes interest payments which was projected at  of GDP If Greece had defaulted in January  this primary surplus could  in theory  have been redirected from interest payments to finance the higher wages  pensions  and public spending that Syriza had promised in its election campaign  Given this possibility  Varoufakis may have believed he was making other EU finance ministers generous offer by proposing to cut the primary surplus from  to  of GDP  rather than all the way to zero  If the EU refused  his implied threat was simply to stop paying interest and make the entire primary surplus available for extra public spending But what if the primary surplus the Greek government trump card in its confrontational negotiating strategy has now disappeared  In that case  the threat of default is no longer credible  With the primary surplus gone  default would no longer permit Tsipras to fulfill Syriza campaign promises  on the contrary  it would imply even bigger cutbacks in wages  pensions  and public spending than the  troika  the European commission  the European Central Bank  and the IMF is now demanding For the EU authorities  by contrast  Greek default would now be much less problematic than previously assumed  They no longer need to deter default by threatening Greece with expulsion from the euro  Instead  the EU can now rely on the Greek government itself to punish its people by failing to pay wages and pensions and honour bank guarantees Tsipras and Varoufakis should have seen this coming  because the same thing happened two years ago  when Cyprus  in the throes of banking crisis  attempted to defy the EU  The Cyprus experience suggests that  with the credibility of the government default threat in tatters  the EU is likely to force Greece to stay in the euro and put it through an American style municipal bankruptcy  like that of Detroit The legal and political mechanisms for treating Greece like municipal bankruptcy are clear  The European treaties state unequivocally that euro membership is irreversible unless country decides to exit not just from the single currency but from the entire EU  That is also the political message that EU governments want to instill in their own citizens and financial investors If Greece defaults  the EU will be legally justified and politically motivated to insist that the euro remains its only legal tender  Even if the Greek government decides to pay wages and pensions by printing its own IOUs or  new drachmas the European court of justice will rule that all domestic debts and bank deposits must be repaid in euros  That  in turn  will force default against Greek citizens  as well as foreign creditors  because the government will be unable to honour the euro value of insured deposits in Greek banks So Greek default within the euro  far from allowing Syriza to honour its election promises  would inflict even greater austerity on Greek voters than they endured under the troika programme  At that point  the government collapse would become inevitable  Instead of Greece exiting the eurozone  Syriza would exit the Greek government  As soon as Tsipras realises that the rules of the game between Greece and Europe have changed  his capitulation will be just matter of time   Project Syndicate

Tony Abbott says iron ore inquiry must not become  witch hunt ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/18/tony-abbott-says-iron-ore-inquiry-must-not-become-a-witch-hunt,business,Tony Abbott has sought to reassure wary colleagues and big mining companies that any government backed inquiry into Australia iron ore sector would be fact finding mission rather than an attempt to regulate the market The prime minister said on Monday parliamentary inquiry  may well be very good way  to sift through various claims about the iron ore market  but it was important that the terms of reference be framed in way to avoid  witch hunt  against particular companies The comments followed concerns from some ministers that parliamentary inquiry would send the wrong signal to Australia trading partners  But the finance minister  Mathias Cormann  who is based in Western Australia  appeared to be comfortable with an inquiry so long as it was  handled maturely in responsible fashion  The push is being championed by the WA based chairman of Fortescue Metals Group  Andrew Forrest  who has accused Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton of increasing iron ore production to reduce prices and damage smaller competitors  Rio Tinto and BHP have rejected this criticism After reports that at least two ministers Andrew Robb and Ian Macfarlane were opposed to government backed inquiry  Abbott sought to allay concerns The prime minister said iron ore was one of Australia  absolutely critical industries  and it was important to know what was happening in the sector  think it is important to get to the facts and an inquiry may well be very good way of doing that he said during visit to Mackay in Queensland  If we are going to have an inquiry it has got to be fair inquiry  it can be witch hunt  it can be directed against any particular company or companies it has got to be fair and square and reasonable  Abbott added that the government would not make  any attempt to regulate market which is working well  and  the last thing we want to do is to crackdown on people creativity  WA Liberal backbencher Dennis Jensen said he did not think an inquiry was good idea  arguing Australia could not be viewed in isolation and it should be up to the companies to decide the rate of production  If you ve got free market  you ve got free market he said I don know what information an inquiry is going to give you apart from the observation that some miners have lower quality resources than others and with low iron ore price it means that some operations become marginal  Macfarlane  the industry minister  said cabinet was yet to make final decision on an inquiry and he would express his views directly to his colleagues  We ll wait and see the outcome of that he said I sure all of those views will be discussed in cabinet and as result of that cabinet discussion proposal will be put to the party room  Robb  the trade minister  said he expected decision  in the next week or so   The leadership group have  quite appropriately  been canvassing views  various views amongst various colleagues he told the ABC I ve put my views  as others have  to the leadership group  The independent senator Nick Xenophon gave notice last week that he would move motion in the Senate to set up an iron ore inquiry  but did not press ahead with it after discussions with the treasurer  Joe Hockey  The government was looking at establishing joint committee inquiry chaired by government member Xenophon said the terms of reference should cover the long term economic and budgetary implications of the fall in iron ore prices  and to look fairly robustly at the allegations made by Andrew Forrest about the iron ore market and the power of BHP and Rio   m sure that BHP and Rio  and for that matter Andrew Forrest  are big enough and ugly enough to put their cases forward and answer whatever questions are thrown at them Xenophon said Why is it that there are some cabinet ministers who are more concerned about this inquiry going ahead than one of the miners that would be called to give evidence at the inquiry  Rio Tinto iron ore boss  Andrew Harding  indicated the company was not worried about what facts an inquiry might uncover A parliamentary inquiry into iron ore would show that the market is operating freely  openly and normally  Harding said  however  that parliamentarians should be mindful of the signal such an inquiry would send to major trading partners  Australia reputation as supporter of open markets  he said  had  already been undermined by calls to cap iron ore production and for government intervention in the market  Cormann said parliamentary inquiry might simply  separate fact from fiction  and not necessarily lead to any changes But then again  it might well be that there are some sensible suggestions on things that could be explored the finance minister said The opposition leader  Bill Shorten  said Labor would closely examine the proposed terms of reference  but warned the government to  be careful that they re not putting politics ahead of commonsense in the long term  The manager of government business in the Senate  Mitch Fifield  said the Coalition did not  have anything to fear  from an inquiry focused on finding facts  but told Sky News We re not the sort of government that is going to seek to intervene in markets or to unnecessarily tame the animal spirits  Labor shadow assistant treasurer  Andrew Leigh  told the same program he took  the old fashioned view that parliament ought to write the competition laws and leave it to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to administer them  
Joe Hockey budget has wrecked the chances of fair tax review,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/may/18/joe-hockeys-budget-has-wrecked-the-chances-of-a-fair-tax-review,business,Last week budget attempted to show path back to surplus  But it is questionable path based on spending cuts from last year that have not yet passed  cuts to state funding that have yet to be agreed and projected taxation where revenue returns would need to be at the levels of the Howard years The dependence upon strong taxation growth from income and company tax however also throws into question the government taxation review  Having already ruled out number of changes to the tax system  the reliance on revenue growth means any changes to income and company taxes will almost certainly destroy chances of return to surplus When Joe Hockey released the  Better Tax  discussion paper the rhetoric at first was that very much that everything was up for discussion  For example  unlike the ALP tax review conducted by then treasury secretary  Ken Henry  this review would consider GST But very quickly it became clear that being  on the table  for discussion did not mean it was on the table for consideration It did not take long for Joe Hockey to rule out changes to negative gearing  Despite pretty clear evidence that the removal of negative gearing in the   didn cause rents to rise  the treasurer has continued to peddle this as truth In the run up to the budget when Labor Chris Bowen told ABC Leigh Sales that Labor would take  any changes we took to negative gearing  to the next election  Joe Hockey quickly ruled out any changes  He told the media the following day If you change negative gearing  then there are significant flow on consequences from people that rent homes  He suggested that the tax discussion paper means  we are having national conversation about taxation  which sounded very open minded  except he then threw in very big  but  but d say this  lot of Australians have invested their hard earned money in real estate  and in doing so  they have offset the losses of that real estate against their primary income in order to give themselves and their children some financial security  And just to make clear his position  he again brought up rents by arguing that  there is very strong argument that if you were to abolish negative gearing  you would see significant increase in rents  For lot of people  massive increase in rents is so unaffordable  But of course  it all on the table Another area was superannuation  After the tax discussion paper was introduced Hockey appeared at least open to the idea of changing taxation concessions on superannuation  He told ABC John Faine that he  would love to have bipartisan approach in all these issues  and that the interaction of pension aged care and superannuation were  under very active consideration at the moment  But very quickly  once the ALP began mooting changes to the superannuation tax concessions  Joe Hockey toed the Liberal Party line that the ALP just wanted to raise tax On  April he compared it with the mining tax and the carbon tax and told reports that  Labor default position is always to increase taxes By the budget last Tuesday he was firmer  there will be no new taxes on superannuation under this government  So cross that off the list of items on the table The problem for Joe Hockey is that his budget seeks to get back to surplus on the basis of getting chunk more income tax than in the past This year the government expects to raise   bn in total individual income tax  By   this is expected to rise to   bn By   individual income tax revenue will have risen to   of GDP the highest level since the GST was introduced in July  In the same period the level of company tax revenue is expected to increase by   in dollar terms  and from  of GDP in   to  of GDP This also means that the budget is becoming more dependent upon income and company tax In   individual income tax  company taxes and resources rent taxes accounted for   of all tax revenue  By   that will rise to   But this brings with it problems that have already been highlighted by Hockey own tax review discussion paper as well as the OECD Within the OECD  Australia is one of the most dependent upon income and company tax revenue The tax discussion paper highlighted that one problem with reliance on income tax is that bracket creep can reduce people propensity to work The over reliance on company tax is also problem given companies  ability to move profits around and avoid paying tax  as well as the need to attract foreign investment by lowering tax when other countries company tax rates are going down And yet growth in income tax and company tax are the major foundations upon which Joe Hockey path to surplus is paved In his budget reply speech Bill Shorten made mention of the bracket creep and he told Leigh Sales that he was willing to sit down with Tony Abbott and  look at all of what we ve got to do and see what we can do collectively  But to give an idea of the problems of collecting revenue from income  were the level of income tax kept steady at the current   of GDP rather than rising to    the government would raise around  bn less in tax over the next four years By   alone  around  bn less in tax would be raised if the level of tax as percentage of GDP was kept steady  That is about quarter of the  bn in GST that is expected to be raised in   So if Hockey or Abbott or Shorten wish to fix bracket creep by cutting income tax  they are going to need to find fair stack of money elsewhere to remain on track for surplus But Tony Abbott last week ruled out any changes to superannuation tax arguing in parliament that the ALP  all live on Planet Tax  There their carbon tax  their mining tax  there all the superannuation taxes  And yet the prime minister has pretty much also ruled out any changes to the GST  In January he told reporters that  there will be no changes to the GST in the first term of the Coalition government  We have no plans to change the GST  Moreover  in December last year Joe Hockey told Channel that there was not the  the financial capacity  to change the GST  He noted correctly that  if you increase the GST  you need to compensate middle and low income Australians with significant tax cuts  And that would be tax cuts to the very tax that Hockey needs to keep growing to achieve his surplus As noted last week the path to surplus is pretty rocky  but the budget has also made the path to any tax reform nigh on impossible

What is summer  s big fashion trend Hint  it not Alexa Chung M skirt ,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/18/hot-fashion-trend-2015-alexa-chung-suede-skirt,fashion,What is the look of summer  Women of Britain  by emailThere are  of course  plenty of lines could spin you about this  Number one is some guff about the mid length skirt  which all the fashion magazines and blogs are pushing as the length of the season  They do this every few years by my reckoning  about every three and it not bad idea  After all  most style conscious women aren likely to own skirts that end midway down their calves so they will then have to go out and buy them  there is little to be gained by the fashion industry from saying that  say  miniskirts are in because young women generally already have about thousand shoved in drawer at home  The reason women tend not to own many mid length skirts is that they look terrible  Oh sure  some women look great in them long  willowy women who wear them and look like elegant bohemian gazelles in their mid length Marni dresses  But these women look elegant in anything  so who cares  The rest of us  however  suspect we look like substitute teachers from the   and feel about as elegant as dumplings Truly  only the rangiest of gazelles feel elegant in skirt that cuts across at the widest part of the calf  What that  you say  Marks Spencer has made mid length skirt in suede that is absolutely the dernier cri  Oh please  tell me more about this skirt because honestly don think it been written about enough everywhere in every British publication  For those who have managed to avoid reading about this accursed skirt  and can only assume you must be Trappist monks M has knocked out some s style skirt that was worn once by Alexa Chung  OMIGOD SCREAM OMIGOD STOP THE PRESSES OMIGOD  etc forever which has therefore been deemed Statement Piece  and has only just gone on sale  even though it feels like it been promoted since  as Kanye West would say  Prince was on Apollonia and OJ had Isotoners  Now  we ve been here before with S statement pieces  namely the famous  nay  HISTORIC  saga of the S pink coat  which was deemed back in  to be the Statement Piece  Leaving aside the fact that both the pink coat and suede skirt are ugly as sin  one made women look like Barbara Cartland in an utterly wrong way  the other makes them look like Jessie from Toy Story in an even worse way the link between them is that they represent triumph of S PR over actual fashion for women  Let me explain with my years of undercover work at the coalface of fashion how these Statement Pieces emerge  occasionally  garment will be knocked out by high street chain that is deemed  by its PR department  to be  marketable It will then give this garment to photogenic celebrity  Chung or Moss  ideally  but random foreign celebrities  such as Blake Lively  Diane Kruger or Olivia Palermo will also do As soon as one of them wears said garment  the PR department will email every fashion editor in the land with the subject heading  JUST IN  or  BREAKING  or  EXCLUSIVE or similar word to denote its pressing newsworthiness  The fashion press will duly fall in line and promote the garment  mindful that this high street outlet buys significant amount of advertising in its publication and therefore will not take kindly to being ignored  Et voila  high street Statement Piece is born  So if you ever wondered at the disjunct between fashion articles telling you that women across Britain are  clamouring  to buy certain item of clothing and the noted lack of this garment on any woman you actually know or even see on the street  now you know why  Truly  it like ve pulled back the curtain and revealed the Wizard of Oz is actually just harassed PR named Natalie  isn it Let all just agree to ignore the fuss about the midi skirt  and particularly the S midi skirt  and look instead at what is actually the look of the summer  And that  my friends  is the Breton shirt  know  know this is not news  right  Every single one of you has about three Breton shirts in your cupboard at home and one on your person right now  But think it worth noting how fast this item has become veritable basic for British women  really just over the course of the past half decade  have one friend who collects them from different retailers  another who had to go cold turkey when she realised she owned   had some friends round for barbecue this weekend and there were three Breton tops between us  and there would have been four if hadn changed moments before lunch  due to some unfortunate mustard spillage You won read about this in any of the fashion magazines because  as say  there is nothing to be gained by promoting something that women already have  And the Breton shirt has become as much of signifier of the British woman in summer as cropped trousers is of the  plus British woman on holiday in warm climate  Some might say it is too ubiquitous to be considered proper fashion now  but those people can swan off in their ugly mid length suede skirts and leave us be Breton ed ones to enjoy ourselves around the barbecue  mind the mustard  Post your

Where there is oil and gas there is Schlumberger,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/where-there-is-oil-and-gas-there-is-schlumberger,environment,In the dying hours of high level conference on the banks of the Thames late in April  two oil executives are sitting patiently waiting on faded leather chairs in the lobby of five star Tower Bridge hotel  briefcases  architects  plans and folded flipchart pad at their feet The two bespectacled executives  looking much like soberly suited bank managers  soon disappear into private room to meet with Dr Abdullahi Haider  senior adviser to the Somalian government  and Canadian middleman  emerging an hour or so later Somalia could be one of the great untapped sources of offshore oil  if someone can secure deal to find and extract it  and if anyone can  it the company these men work for The oil firm that makes  bn year and you ve probably never even heard of it  keepitintheground http t co   bIblQ The African nation is one of the most politically unstable  unsafe  and corrupt countries in the world  one of the toughest places for any business to think of operating But that is what Schlumberger the biggest company you ve never heard of do  if the rewards are great enough Schlumberger were the  gold  sponsors of the conference  two day event attracting around   delegates to discuss how to unlock Somalia potentially vast  and so far untapped  oil and gas reserves The contents of the four men discussions as the conference organisers packed up around them  and of their tubes of plans  remain confidential  The executives  characteristically of the secretive oil giant  declined to tell The Guardian what they had discussed Schlumberger employs more than   people finding  scoping  and drilling as much oil and gas as possible from  countries across the world  With revenues of  bn   bn  year and valuation in excess of   bn   bn it has more staff than Google  turns over more than Goldman Sachs  and is worth more than McDonald It works with every major international oil company  and directly for most of the petrostates including Saudi Arabia  Libya  Russia and Turkmenistan  It operates in the most difficult areas  whether politically  logistically  or technologically  and it is world leader in the technologies required to get fossil fuels out of the ground with    patented ways to help its clients do just that  And it does all of this while staying well out of the limelight But with plea deal with the US authorities finalised at the end of last month  Schlumberger set corporate record it would probably prefer not to be noticed  receiving the largest corporate criminal fine for sanctions violations in US history Its crime  to which it pled guilty  was to involve its US staff in sanctions busting transactions with both Iran and Sudan  and for its  unsuccessful  attempts to mask such transactions from the authorities Schlumberger is now required to pay   in criminal fines  forfeit  m in earnings  and undergo three years of corporate probation  the business world answer to yellow card  But for  bn year business  which made   profit from Iran in  alone  such fine is just drop in the oil well  The day the deal was struck  Schlumberger shares actually rose almost   visible sign investors saw the punishment as little more than slap on the wrist But the deal shines unprecedented light on some of the inner workings of company central to drilling out fossil fuels right across the planet Schlumberger doesn actually own any oil or gas fields itself  meaning it was not on the Guardian divestment list of   companies as part of its  Keep it in the ground  campaign but as perhaps the most sophisticated oilfields services company on the planet  it is key to deep sea drilling  arctic exploration  re fracking  bid to  stimulate  dwindling fracking site to boost its production  and more  and works with many of the nationally owned oil companies that hold most of the world reserves It does all this with huge   investment from the Wellcome Trust  and the Gates Foundation Trust also holds shareholding of more than m in the company  Schlumberger may lack the public profile of its rival in the field  Halliburton which became notorious among campaigners in the aftermath of the war in Iraq  especially through its ties to controversial former US vice president Dick Cheney but it bigger than it by far  Schlumberger is valued at almost three times its US owned rival  and has around    more staff Schlumberger  founded in  by two French brothers as prospecting company  works under the radar  Where its better known but smaller rivals openly lobby  donate to political parties  and even hire big name politicians  Schlumberger does not  The results show in overage  Halliburton appeared in more than   articles in the British press in the last decade  Schlumberger is in just  mostly short pieces tucked away on the business pages One of Schlumberger tricks of the trade is its near statelessness  Unlike Halliburton  it is not US owned  Despite being publicly listed company both in the US and the UK  and having  headquarters  in London  sleek glass skyscraper just yards from Buckingham Palace Paris  The Hague and Houston  Schlumberger is formally incorporated in Curac ao  Caribbean offshore haven with ties to the Netherlands The company complex structure  which routes its operating companies through subsidiaries in the Netherlands  British Virgin Islands and Panama  often works in its favour  One such upside was for years that Schlumberger was able to operate in Iran and Sudan  despite US sanctions  because it wasn a US company  and so it did including directly for the National Iranian Oil Company The key condition was that no US citizens or staff on US soil must be involved in the contracts  Unfortunately for Schlumberger  the company didn manage to keep to those terms and the US authorities found out  and struck Documents filed by the Department of Justice  and accepted by Schlumberger through its guilty plea  set out how the US sanctions rules were repeatedly and deliberately breached Staff within the US  the document sets out  approved capital spend money for equipment and other needs against the terms of US sanctions  The DoJ document also sets out the steps staff members took to try to cover their tracks  including creating covernames such as referring to Sudan as  Southern Egypt  for the countries concerned when applying for funds   mails often identified Iran and or Sudan  through the use of code words the document states For example  M  drilling measurements  division within Schlumberger  personnel in MEA  Middle East and East Asia  generally referred to Iran as  Northern Gulf  and Sudan as  Southern Egypt  these funds were approved by M personnel in the United States even though they were made by or on behalf of Iran or Sudan  One email exchange between Schlumberger staff highlights staff taking steps to avoid sending anything with the barred country named to US soil  An email to Texas notes  have purposely not sent additional files as they refer to  Southern Egypt  by name  The documents also detail Schlumberger staff modifying country codes to avoid references to Iran and Sudan  as well as arranging equipment  swaps  to facilitate US made equipment getting to sites in Iran and Sudan  by virtue of sending new equipment to permitted countries  like Jordan who didn need it  so as to allow their second hand machinery to be sent on to the barred nations This is to help out Sudan again with their embargo  one employee noted in an email arranging one of the deals Despite its substantial fine and probation  which includes prohibition on Schlumberger operating in Iran and Sudan  it has now exited both analysts regard the issue as largely having passed leaving the company free to do as it will elsewhere  Everyone known the company  Schlumberger  because it sort of dual citizenship   has allowed them to operate in certain areas  which has given them an advantage over certain companies and areas  and Iran was one of them explains David Anderson  oil services and equipment analyst at Barclays They operated in the country and they paid the fine  For the oil analysts  Schlumberger sanctions breaches are thing of the past  an embarrassing moment best forgotten  The company might no longer be able to trade in Iran and Sudan  but is free to continue its operations in some of the world most difficult places to work Schlumberger has proven itself unafraid of contentious customers  with operations in autocratic states widely criticised by human rights groups and western governments  The company clients have included Libya  Burma  Turkmenistan  Chad and Angola Documents disclosed by WikiLeaks in  also shed light on the US State Department views on some of Schlumberger operations at the time  and highlight its presence in some of the most difficult areas in which to operate The US embassy in Turkmenistan noted the company had hired local fixer an  ombudsman  in their parlance to reduce  harassment and extortion by local police which had included dubious  fines tax audits  and even deportation of employees for fratenising with Turkmen women  serious no no in the draconian state On brighter note  the State department memo did record Schlumberger officials  claimed that corruption in Turkmenistan is not as bad as in Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan  countries in which it also operates Elsewhere  Schlumberger had to battle hostage takings and raids in Nigeria where the company  tripled the amount spent on security so it now totaled   of its budget  However  the rewards to the oilfield services companies Schlumberger and its smaller rivals for being willing to work where others fear to tread were also clear  In Kuwait Schlumberger and its rivals had  almost all  of the fieldwork for the national oil company  while in the UAE State Department official remarked in  that  Halliburton  Baker Atlas  Schlumberger and other service providers act as an oligopoly and enjoy exceedingly large profit margins  The core of Schlumberger indispensability to its customer base across the world is its specialism in extracting the most fossil fuels possible  Where its rivals are often said to compete on low costs  Schlumberger offers up technical expertise to seek out and grab every drop of oil  or puff of gas  You could almost say Schlumberger is the Apple of the oil fields  the high tech company  they re ubiquitous explains Robert MacKenzie  an analyst at Iberia Capital Partners and former employee of Schlumberger  If you re trying to develop field and you want the best you hire Schlumberger  If you re not certain how to work it and you want someone to help figure out how you develop it you call Schlumberger  They have driven many technology advances in the industry in the past and they continue to do that  Schlumberger technological dominance is reflected in its formidable patent portfolio  search on Espacenet  an international database operated by the European Patent Office  for Schlumberger reveals more than    patents linked to the firm  The same search for Halliburton gives   while Baker Hughes  the third largest in the sector has     Their technology is real  it legitimate and it is certainly one of the hallmarks of the company says Barclays  David Anderson  who described Schlumberger patent portfolio as the company  calling card  since its inception  It certainly keeps the company profitable  Schlumberger net income topped bn  bn  in   and the company has historically enjoyed better profit margins than its rivals The company is keen to tout its technological edge  with Patrick Schorn  one of the company presidents  telling an energy conference in December  that Schlumberger had been granted   patents in     more than just five years before  with Schorn showcasing technologies to boost fracking  and to scope out the full extent of hard to analyse oil reservoirs Schlumberger then uses this D to make its money making whole new types of drilling possible allowing big western oil and gas companies  plus state owned enterprises to extract exactly the reserves environmental campaigners insist must stay in the ground  The magnitude of deepwater reserves and production potential is simply too large for the industry to ignore chief executive Paul Kibsgaard told an industry audience earlier this year His company promotion material push the same message  o company can match our on going investment in deepwater D one  brochure pledged  before referring to the company  overwhelming market position  in ultra deepwater rigs  risky and controversial form of extraction  particularly in the wake of the very public Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico Schlumberger fossil fuel reliance extends in other ways  The company has recently started offering its refracking customers new  risk free deals  where they pay no revenue unless Schlumberger increases their production beyond certain level  at which point they take share  in sense  making them an oil company in all but name the oil indiustry version of the ambulance chaser  no win  no fee  offer The reliance of the business on fossil fuel extraction is tacitly  if briefly  acknowledged in section of the company official annual filings from   touching on significant potential risks to the business  In the guarded language of the corporate world  it warns  demand for our products and services could be reduced by changes in governmental regulations or in the law   Some international  national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climate related legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas emissions the section then explains  Such legislation   may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services  which may in turn adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  For now  though  the company is still keen and willing to look to untapped frontiers of fossil fuel extraction  with the Arctic being one of the key targets in its sights where they were behind major oil discovery in Russia icy Kara Sea last year And despite its recent run in with the US over sanctions  it is according to Bloomberg report still able to work with Russia in the Arctic extraction  despite US sanctions But with three years of corporate probation to serve  it is sure to be characteristically more careful this time to stay out of the headlines The Guardian contacted Schlumberger five days prior to publication in order to provide the company an opportunity to respond to matters raised in this article  At the time of publication   hours after the an initial deadline for comment  Schlumberger was yet to respond to the Guardian email and questions  other than pointing to recent US DoJ press release relating to the final judgement in the US sanctions case Paal Kibsgaard keeps low profile  Unlike other top executives in the oil industry  Schlumberger Norwegian chief executive and chairman manages to avoid the public eye There are few interviews with the press and only brief biography appears on the company website with career highlights  Made chief executive in    and anointed as chairman in April Kibsgaard joined the firm in  as an engineer in Saudi Arabia and worked his way through company ranks While relatively little may be known about Kibsgaard  he is among the highest paid executives in the US  Last year his total pay packet  including shares and options  hit almost    ahead of Tim Cook of Apple and the chief executives of Nike and Ford  according to data compiled by Equilar Kibsgaard sits at the helm of truly global operation  and in  the  year old from lesund  picturesque port town set among snow glazed mountains on Norway west coast  was named by Foreign Policy magazine as one of the  most powerful people on the planet  Earlier this year  Kibsgaard received medal from another of the world most powerful people  Vladimir Putin  In decree signed by the Russian president  Kibsgaard was awarded the  Order of Friendship  medal for Schlumberger contribution to major discovery in the Russian Arctic Last month  Kibsgaard believed to be the highest paid Norwegian in the world proved to be ruthless operator  slashing Schlumberger workforce by   in response to the fall in oil prices  Meanwhile  investors remain supportive of Kibsgaard presumably thanks to extra generous dividend increases since he took the top job In rare interview last year  Kibsgaard spoke to financial magazine Barron about his ambitions for Schlumberger and offered an ambitious vision I don think we should focus on only being the best company in our industry he said We have the potential to be the best run company in the world  and that what we are trying to do  
Indian Ocean storing up heat from global warming  says study,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/indian-ocean-storing-up-heat-from-global-warming-says-study,environment,The world oceans are playing game of hot potato with the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions Scientists have zeroed in on the tropical Pacific as major player in taking up that heat  But while it might have held that heat for bit  new research shows that the Pacific has passed the potato to the Indian Ocean  which has seen an unprecedented rise in heat content over the past decade The new work builds on series of papers that have tracked the causes for what been dubbed the global warming slowdown  period over the past  years that has seen surface temperatures rise slower than they did the previous decade  Shifts in Pacific tradewinds have helped sequester heat from the surface to the top   feet of the ocean  But unlike Vegas  what happens in the Pacific doesn stay in the Pacific Since   upper ocean heat content has actually been slowly decreasing in the Pacific  When first saw from the data that Pacific temperature was going down  was very curious and puzzled Sang Ki Lee  scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies  said Lee  who led the new research published in Nature Geoscience  looked at records going back to  and noticed that the Indian Ocean heat uptake  was pretty much flat  until   Suddenly  heat began to build there  but it wasn coming from above By running ocean circulation models  he found that the heat stashed in the Pacific had hitched ride on the ocean conveyor belt and danced its way through the Indonesian archipelago  ending up in the Indian Ocean  The Indonesian shuffle means that the Indian Ocean is now home to   of all heat taken up by global oceans during the past decade  This is really important study as it resolves how Pacific Ocean variability has led to the warming slowdown without storing excess ocean heat locally Matthew England  professor at the University of New South Wales  said This resolves long standing debate about how the Pacific has led to warming slowdown when total heat content in that basin has not changed significantly  England led previous research that examined the role of the tradewinds in the Pacific heat uptake Tom Delworth  climate modeler at Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory who has also examined the Pacific trade winds in the hiatus  agreed  though he noted the results are very interesting  but m not sure they help us with predicting the future evolution of the hiatus  Ocean heat content has risen dramatically over the past decade even as surface temperatures have not  Globally  oceans account for   of the heat that has accumulated on the planet since  due to human greenhouse gas emissions A flurry of recent research shows that the current slowdown in surface warming could end in the near future as Pacific trade winds shift  allowing for less heat to enter the ocean In its current location  Lee said it possible that the warm water in the Indian Ocean could affect the Indian Monsoon  one of the most important climate patterns in the world that affects more than one billion people  The current El Nin stewing in the Pacific could be also be affected  It seems pretty clear that an El Nin event  such as this year  would reverse this anomaly  at least while the El Nin is underway Delworth said What its means for future El Nin cycles is less clear  however Lee said it likely to continue globe trotting along the ocean conveyor belt and find its way to the Atlantic in the coming decades  If this warm blob of water in upper Indian Ocean is transported all the way to North Atlantic  that could affect the melting of Arctic sea ice Lee said That can also increase hurricane activity and influence the effects of drought in the US  These are simply hypotheses that need to be tested and studied in the future work

Oxford University rules out investing in coal and tar sands,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/oxford-university-rules-out-investing-in-coal-and-tar-sands,environment,The University of Oxford has ruled out future investments in coal and tar sands from its multi billion pound endowment  but said it would not divest from all fossil fuels as demanded by thousands of students  academics and alumni Campaigners welcomed the move as victory for the fast growing fossil fuel divestment campaign  as it was the first time the university had made clear its position on the issue  Many world leaders have studied under Oxford University spires said Andrew Taylor  at campaign group People Planet They should be taking notes today  The lesson is  it time to phase out coal and axe tar sands  The university  one of the world oldest and most prestigious  follows over   other organisations who have banned some investments in fossil fuels because of their role in driving climate change However  Oxford University said it does not hold any direct investments in coal and tar sands and its announcement on Monday contained little on new investment policies The university failure to commit to divestment from all fossil fuel companies means  alumni  including green energy entrepreneur Jeremy Leggett and journalist George Monbiot  will be handing back their Oxford University degrees on Saturday Sunniva Taylor  an Oxford alumnus said With the decision today the university has taken step forward  but not big enough one   with others  have decided to hand back my degree  in protest  Oxford decision came on the same day that the University of Cambridge announced wide ranging investigation of its own investment policies  The two universities are by far richest in the UK and hold global esteem  with campaigners hoping their choices will influence other investors Oxford decided to exclude companies involved the most polluting fossil fuels coal and tar sands from its direct investments It has demonstrated that universities can carry out their academic mission while also acting with moral integrity in their investment choices said Felix Pinkert  lecturer in philosophy at Oxford However  companies held via mixed investment funds are exempted Professor Andrew Hamilton  vice chancellor of Oxford university  said We see the main purpose of our investment fund as generating the financial resources to support our academic purpose  However  our investment managers take long term view and take into account global risks  including climate change  when considering what investments to make  A series of analyses have shown that current reserves of coal  oil and gas are several times greater than can be burned whilst limiting climate change to the internationally agreed limit of  The fast growing  UN backed divestment campaign argues that the business models of fossil fuel companies  which continue to spend billions on searching for new reserves  are endangering the climate The campaign also argues many fossil fuel assets could become worthless if the world governments act to curb global warming  risk taken seriously by the World Bank and the Bank of England Many universities have divested  including Stanford  Syracuse and Glasgow  as have with faith groups like the Church of England and philanthropic funds such as the Rockefeller Brother fund  which was founded on oil wealth  The Guardian is running campaign asking the world largest health charities  the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust  to divest and the Guardian Media Group has divested its own   fund  the largest to date  Oxford is the ultimate long term investor with large amount of capital held in perpetuity  As result  its endowment is naturally going to be concerned about long term risks like climate change  It is credit to the endowment that it doesn have any direct investments in coal and tar sands said Ben Caldecott  director of the Stranded Assets Programme at the University of Oxford  Today announcement confirming that Oxford will avoid all such investments in the future is good risk based decision that puts it on par with other leading universities  such as Stanford  Some institutions have argued that holding shares allows them to engage with managers over changes their companies and Oxford University has now decided that its investment committee will report annually on its engagement  The university also said it would give full breakdown of its investments in specific sectors and revealed that  of its endowment was in energy  More than half of the energy investments are in exploration and extraction 
Fossil fuels subsidised by  a minute  says IMF,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf,environment,Fossil fuel companies are benefitting from global subsidies of   tn  tn  year  equivalent to  a minute every day  according to startling new estimate by the International Monetary Fund The IMF calls the revelation  shocking  and says the figure is an  extremely robust  estimate of the true cost of fossil fuels  The   tn subsidy estimated for  is greater than the total health spending of all the world governments The vast sum is largely due to polluters not paying the costs imposed on governments by the burning of coal  oil and gas  These include the harm caused to local populations by air pollution as well as to people across the globe affected by the floods  droughts and storms being driven by climate change Nicholas Stern  an eminent climate economist at the London School of Economics  said This very important analysis shatters the myth that fossil fuels are cheap by showing just how huge their real costs are  There is no justification for these enormous subsidies for fossil fuels  which distort markets and damages economies  particularly in poorer countries  Lord Stern said that even the IMF vast subsidy figure was significant underestimate A more complete estimate of the costs due to climate change would show the implicit subsidies for fossil fuels are much bigger even than this report suggests  The IMF  one of the world most respected financial institutions  said that ending subsidies for fossil fuels would cut global carbon emissions by  That would be giant step towards taming global warming  an issue on which the world has made little progress to date Ending the subsidies would also slash the number of premature deaths from outdoor air pollution by   about   million lives year Furthermore  the IMF said the resources freed by ending fossil fuel subsidies could be an economic  game changer  for many countries  by driving economic growth and poverty reduction through greater investment in infrastructure  health and education and also by cutting taxes that restrict growth Another consequence would be that the need for subsidies for renewable energy a relatively tiny   bn year would also disappear  if fossil fuel prices reflected the full cost of their impacts  These  fossil fuel subsidy  estimates are shocking said Vitor Gaspar  the IMF head of fiscal affairs and former finance minister of Portugal Energy prices remain woefully below levels that reflect their true costs  David Coady  the IMF official in charge of the report  said When the  tn  number came out at first  we thought we had better double check this But the broad picture of huge global subsidies was  extremely robust he said It is the true cost associated with fossil fuel subsidies  The IMF estimate of   tn in fossil fuel subsidies represents  of global GDP  Just over half the figure is the money governments are forced to spend treating the victims of air pollution and the income lost because of ill health and premature deaths  The figure is higher than    IMF estimate because new data from the World Health Organisation shows the harm caused by air pollution to be much higher than thought Coal is the dirtiest fuel in terms of both local air pollution and climate warming carbon emissions and is therefore the greatest beneficiary of the subsidies  with just over half the total  Oil  heavily used in transport  gets about third of the subsidy and gas the rest The biggest single source of air pollution is coal fired power stations and China  with its large population and heavy reliance on coal power  provides   tn of the annual subsidies  The next biggest fossil fuel subsidies are in the US  bn Russia  bn India  bn  and Japan  bn with the European Union collectively allowing   bn in subsidies to fossil fuels The costs resulting from the climate change driven by fossil fuel emissions account for subsidies of  tn year  about quarter  of the IMF total  The IMF calculated this cost using an official US government estimate of   tonne of CO in  dollars a price  very likely to underestimate  the true cost  according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change The direct subsidising of fuel for consumers  by government discounts on diesel and other fuels  account for just  of the IMF total  Other local factors  such as reduced sales taxes on fossil fuels and the cost of traffic congestion and accidents  make up the rest  The IMF says traffic costs are included because increased fuel prices would be the most direct way to reduce them Christiana Figueres  the UN climate change chief charged with delivering deal to tackle global warming at crunch summit in December  said The IMF provides five trillion reasons for acting on fossil fuel subsidies  Protecting the poor and the vulnerable is crucial to the phasing down of these subsidies  but the multiple economic  social and environmental benefits are long and legion  Barack Obama and the   nations called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies in   but little progress had been made until oil prices fell in   In April  the president of the World Bank  Jim Yong Kim  told the Guardian that it was crazy that governments were still driving the use of coal  oil and gas by providing subsidies We need to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies now he said Reform of the subsidies would increase energy costs but Kim and the IMF both noted that existing fossil fuel subsidies overwhelmingly go to the rich  with the wealthiest   of people getting six times as much as the poorest   in low and middle income countries  Gaspar said that with oil and coal prices currently low  there was  golden opportunity  to phase out subsidies and use the increased tax revenues to reduce poverty through investment and to provide better targeted support Subsidy reforms are beginning in dozens of countries including Egypt  Indonesia  Mexico  Morocco and Thailand  In India  subsidies for diesel ended in October    People said it would not be possible to do that noted Coady  Coal use has also begun to fall in China for the first time this century On renewable energy  Coady said If we get the pricing of fossil fuels right  the argument for subsidies for renewable energy will disappear  Renewable energy would all of sudden become much more attractive option  Shelagh Whitley  subsidies expert at the Overseas Development Institute  said The IMF report is yet another reminder that governments around the world are propping up century old energy model  Compounding the issue  our research shows that many of the energy subsidies highlighted by the IMF go toward finding new reserves of oil  gas and coal  which we know must be left in the ground if we are to avoid catastrophic  irreversible climate change  Developing the international cooperation needed to tackle climate change has proved challenging but key message from the IMF work  according to Gaspar  is that each nation will directly benefit from tackling its own fossil fuel subsidies The icing on the cake is that the benefits from subsidy reform for example  from reduced pollution would overwhelmingly accrue to local populations he said  By acting local  and in their own best interest nations  can contribute significantly to the solution of global challenge said Gaspar The path forward is clear  act local  solve global

Email mishaps   tales of mistaken identity,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/18/email-mishaps-12-tales-of-mistaken-identity,technology,There some guy living in the Pacific NW who has apparently spent the last three years thinking his email address is my email address I get  so  much stuff for this guy  can more or less plot vague outline of his month to month life at this point  He works as some sort of freelance consultant  and wonder how it going because he presumably missed number of important meetings  updates and debriefings in the last  months  owing to the fact that get updates about them rather than him  He also been having lot of renovations on his house in the last year  and much as d like to confirm Tuesday would be good time for the roofer to drop by for quote  can  because live  miles away and don know if he free on Tuesday the same reason can confirm that his air conditioning unit was delivered last week  or that it ok for his party of four booking at local restaurant on Friday to be pushed back an hour  He appears to be having difficulty selling his former property  m not that surprised I worry about him about the changes to meeting locations and apologies for missed barbecues he most likely never hears about  wonder how many local delivery companies have him flagged as the guy who never home when they show up  how many times he walked away from empty conference rooms  minutes after the meeting was due to start  wondering why he always the last to know I know his  life  well enough by now that it pretty clear to me whenever get one of these emails  and which ones are important or personal  and which ones nobody going to miss  And wherever possible  have replied with shorter version of this post to Lauri at the air conditioning company  to Steve from the outside consultancy firm  to Wendy about the barbecue  to the restaurant about the booking and begged them to let him know that  somehow in this day and age  this poor guy either  doesn actually know  his own email address or that  he has an email address that SOUNDS like mine over the phone  and he needs to clarify that people have jotted it down properly The most ve ever got back has been one or two very brief apologies  never confirmation that they have an alternative contact for him and that they ll pass on the message  Never an email from the guy thanking me for taking the time  perhaps laughing about all the years he just thought people were ignoring him  ve even worked out various versions email addresses can think of which might regularly be mistaken for mine over the phone  and speculatively written to those too  Nothing  Although two of them didn bounce back On we go  alexhern My best friend has common name as well as me  we re discussing your article pic twitter com MtFfptdh cThe most disturbing one was from  well known  UK solicitor who was handling the divorce of his client and there was lot of money involved  replied immediately and pointed out their mistake  few weeks later the same  again replied And again  This time called the solicitor directly and told him if he doesn get his act together will inform his client  After all he did not only provide details of physical abuse  bank statements  her whereabouts  she was in  safe house to complete stranger who is aware that her husband is looking for her and is pretty loaded  but also his intended tactics then received an email from him trying to intimidate him and suggesting broke the law for reading emails which are not addressed to me printed out the emails  send it to his client with letter assuring her that have no malicious intention but want to protect her  was going through divorce myself at that time and could sympathise with her worries  and suggested she should change her solicitor  Which she did   ole alexhern My name is much more common in the States than here the best misaddressed email ever got was this one pic twitter com bWs CpyfMhI feel your pain Having the name Richard Thomas and living in Wales  nation not renowned for its wide variety of surnames  get this lot My work email is constantly filling up with misdirected requests and frequently find my personal account signed up to random services A highlight was receiving an email thanking me for signing up to an online dating site when my then girlfriend was sat right next to me  alexhern my favourite alt me is the sheriff from the US who orders cars parts and signs up to hook up websites to cheat on his fiance As university student  every few months receive emails addressed to one of my lecturers who shares the same first name as me  but whose surname is completely different  The contents of the emails have ranged from other students on my course asking me questions about material covered in lectures  of which have no real authority on  to academics congratulating me on the publication of papers hadn written When receive such emails  make sure to forward it on to my lecturer  copying it to the original sender in the hopes that they won repeat their mistake  am bit puzzled as to why this keeps happening though  Do people simply enter my lecturer first name and department into the directory search facility and pick the first option on the list  That seems to me like rather foolish thing to do  Perhaps my university should offer course on the proper use of email  alexhern friend once got congrats on his  non existent  upcoming wedding and so told his  friend  it was off as his fiance was cheating  alexhern  chrisapplegate For ages was cc  not bcc  in on all the correspondence of the Arkansas chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous Lol For several YEARS had mailerdaemon as my account at comcast net  You are saying  so what What happens when you send an email and you typo the name  You get an email saying I sorry that address doesn exist  signed mailer daemon That email is generated by your mail provider BUT they make up return address for it  They forge the address  And so some isps would forge mailerdaemon at comcast when comcast would bounce the message So what  you say is this going to end with Tree Fiddy Nope  There are idiots out there who REPLY to those bounce messages with questions like why didn you deliver my message  yeah may have trolled few people I had that account for like  years before comcast took it away  They were really nice about it  alexhern Every few years m bombarded with emails from people standing for the election in North Carolina There is some guy in America with name similar to mine who  is desperate to find girlfriend  and  doesn know his own email address  Whether these are related is matter of debate  but nonetheless has resulted in me getting steady stream of emails from various dating agencies thanking me for signing up and offering me various possible matches Dealing with this has ranged from the amusing to the infuriating  In some cases simple unsubscribe has stopped them  In couple of cases  ve logged on to the site  well  it my email address  so get to reset the password  and changed  my  profile to be about as unattractive as it can possibly be  One site didn allow me to unbsubscribe or change the profile  so instead changed the email address and redirected the new one to the site founder In other  similar incidents  regularly get invoices from private hospital in Singapore  More recently  some unfortunate traveller is not going to be able to fly from Washington to Dallas  as have his ticket  And on one occasion  some chap girlfriend sent me selfie that was  well  not really what think she would have wanted stranger to see 
The video game industry has dress code driven by lack of diversity,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/18/video-game-industry-dress-code-plaid-denim,technology,Most professions have uniform of some kind  whether it the suit and tie of corporate culture  or the brand asserting mono wear of the world major retail outlets  Sometimes  however  dress codes can be much more insidious  In the world of video games  young creative industry that seeks to assert its rebelliousness and vibrancy  we aren required to conform through necessity or tradition  But one thing discovered very quickly when started working here is that there is uniform  it just that this one is the result  not of workplace rules  but of lack of diversity  And it can be just as excluding It was the night of my very first launch party  d just finished my internship at video games TV channel and was going through the familiar routine of choosing an outfit  In other words  was trying on everything in my own wardrobe as well as the wardrobes of all my flatmates  eventually decided on something d been saving for special occasion  patterned mid length dress with black panels down the side  sent photo of it to the colleague who invited me  but her replied surprised me It lovely  but bit too dressy for tonight I wore it anyway When we arrived at the event  realised straight away that she was right  was greeted with sea of plaid and denim  amid which you could sometimes pick out the odd shirt  usually bearing video game or movie reference so obscure only the wearer and four of their friends would ever understand it  There were barely any women there  and most of those were publishers or in marketing  rather than developers  felt like lone speck of femininity in musty fog of identikit men The white guy in checked shirt  jeans and trainers  Possibly with beard  It the joke we often make about the industry  but there is plenty of truth in the stereotype  This tweet from developer  Games  although clearly joke  pretty much sums things up Just another day at the  offices  pic twitter com PZs VRslI Go to any games event  whether its major premiere or an indie expo  and the room will be filled with people in this ensemble  It not that men shouldn dress as lumberjacks everyone deserves the freedom to wear what they want but the unremitting casualness of the games industry has almost become stifling uniform in itself  Most of the time  you ll only ever see anything smarter at formal event  like the Bafta awards and even then  we re talking hired Moss Bros suits or emergency polyester purchases from the nearest budget clothing outlet  In this industry smart  means wearing your box fresh Adidas Sambas rather than those battered Converse with the sole flapping off  m fond of dresses  but whenever dared wear one to the office would be met with chorus of  what the occasion  I entered the games industry as  year old woman facing professional environment dominated by men  In its  workplace study  the International Game Developer Association found that the number of women in the industry has doubled in the past five years  but it still stands at just  And at industry events it can feel like lot less  was acutely aware of standing out  the clothes liked to wear didn fit in with the consensus of casual boyishness  Consequently  found myself consciously wearing more androgynous outfits  my dresses and skirts were pushed to the back of the wardrobe  and started choosing plainer clothes that wouldn have really considered before  Goodbye beloved floral line dress  hello plain black shirt As woman who often appears in front of camera was particularly self conscious of choosing anything that could be considered  sexy I was once told by seasoned industry professional that they were reluctant to let myself and female colleague stream video together as they didn want to look like they were  selling sex Somehow  internet commenters started to have an influence they made me think that my body wasn something that belonged to me  but to those who looked at me  The way to combat that was to tone down the way dressed  To be taken seriously as video games journalist  had to avoid looking  sexy  or  girly  It taken me over year  along with meeting and befriending other inspirational women in the industry  to realise that changing my style so that can fit in is wrong  uniform implies control and regimentation  and this is young and creative industry  where those constraints should not apply  Indeed  we are lucky to be part of culture that is still forming its own identity that can be wonderful thing  We joke about the stereotypical games industry look  but we need to be aware that it is the product of lack of diversity  both in terms of gender and ethnicity as such it can seem just as exclusionary as the tailored suit and tie of the professional world Of course  m not saying that the whole industry needs makeover  but it has to be more welcoming toward different concepts of style and identity  Creativity begins with how we feel and how we see and present ourselves as people  This industry isn just dressing identically  it draws its inspiration from the same music  movies and books  This homogeneity leads to staid ideas I now happily wear my floral line dress to video game events  and yes  do stand out  but that fine  In an industry that lacks it  difference is good thing to have

Chatterbox  Monday,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/18/chatterbox-monday,technology,Oh  it Monday  How did that happen 
California surf wars  wave  warlords  go to extreme lengths to defend their turf,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/18/california-surf-wars-lunada-bay-localism-surfing,travel,Lunada Bay is legendary surfing spot at the base of cliffs on the Palos Verdes peninsula  just south of Los Angeles After clambering down steep  crumbling path  visitors encounter smooth beach  vista of the Pacific Ocean and waves breaking against the point  with just handful of surfers out in the foam It looks idyllic  Should you enter the water  however  three things may happen  the surfers may surround  harass and possibly assault you  Their friends may roll rocks on you as you clamber back up the cliff  Your car may be vandalised Lunada Bay is famous not just for its waves but also its  Bay Boys  self professed locals who have monopolised the spot for decades by intimidating outsiders When Guardian reporter and photographer recently visited  clutching surfboards  the Bay Boys warned us to leave immediately  The reason there a lot of space is because we keep it like that  We fucking hassle people said one man in his fifties as he pulled on wetsuit and prepared to paddle out  Like the others  he declined to give his name They would sabotage any outsider attempt to surf  he said We ll burn you every single wave Violence was last resort because it could lead to criminal charges and hiring lawyer  he said That ll cost me  grand  don want to go through that shit again  Four other surfers mostly middle aged  all men made similar threats and said we were being monitored from the cliffs When we returned to our car up on the bluff it was smeared with eggs and someone had used surf wax to scratch  kooks slang for amateurs  on the windows Welcome to surfing  localism  the term for an aggressive territorial streak found in surfing communities across the world  Typically  group declares particular beach  local  and uses varying levels of menace to deter outsiders  dubbed  trolls and force them onto crowded non local beaches As surfing continues to explode in popularity  localism and other general boorish behaviour in the waves face increasing pressure and scrutiny  Phone cameras and drones capture violence which previously went unrecorded Popular culture imagines laid back vibe  but surfing was always closer to Lord of the Flies  said Johnny Lockwood  surfer who has encountered localism at Malibu beaches  miles north of Lunada Bay I had dreams d come to California and everything would be groovy  There this sort of under the wire terrorism  Interlopers risked finding their cars covered with surf wax and sand  or being confronted in the water  said Lockwood The only remedy to that is if you have crew with bunch of buddies Hardcore locals  he said  were incorrigible It like dealing with warlords  The phenomenon began in the   when cheaper  lighter boards and Gidget  fictional girl surfer popularised in book  film and TV series  turned surfing into mainstream sport  producing crowding on the waves Localism declared certain beaches off limits  with Lunada Bay reputedly southern California most forbidding spot The area is known as war zone of sorts the Los Angeles Times reported in   citing assaults  rock throwing and vandalism Outside surfers accused police and the authorities of Palos Verdes Estates  wealthy town of big houses and lawn sprinklers  of turning blind eye to thuggishness from well heeled local surfers The outsiders sued and appeared to win in   Bay Boy agreed to pay   in damages and Palos Verdes Estate conceded to issue public proclamation that the beach was open to everyone But intimidation continued and outsiders stayed away  In  the police chief installed  surf cam  to stream images from the beach and quell aggression  The Bay Boys nixed that too  by warning residents the images would lure hordes of visitors  An alarmed city council voted unanimously to remove the camera Last year thread on Reddit prompted renewed attempt to end the bullying of  relatively small crew of spoiled trust fund babies Protestors renamed the bay Aloha Bay and staged one day act of defiance  with handful paddling out into the surf  monitored by police watching from the bluffs The event passed off without incident and  it seems  impact  When the Guardian visited Lunada Bay recently  at sunny weekend with good swell  there was only one outsider surfer  young Frenchman  sitting apprehensively in his car  police officer had warned him he faced harassment  possibly violence  if he tried to surf  he said  requesting anonymity  He decided it was not worth the risk and drove away At the police station  an officer told the Guardian police would respond if the Bay Boys broke the law They re pretty much grown men in little men mindsets  It is like game on the schoolyard to them and they don want you playing on their swing set  Every surfer encountered on the beach warned of vague  unpleasant consequences if we entered the water  Too many damn surfers  not enough waves  that why there localism  man said one  plucking beer from an ice box If we let every nice guy surf  there be hundred guys out here  You have to nip it in the bud  The reason it not crowded is that people protect it  It was the only way to avoid being overrun  he said It fucked  dude  People think we re bunch of assholes  but you know what  We want to keep it like this so we can go somewhere where it fucking sacred Friends  ashes  he added  had been scattered on the waves Gidget  the fictional character who kickstarted the boom  was based on Kathy Kohner Zuckerman  who as teenager started surfing Malibu deserted beaches in   Zuckerman  now   takes pride that her father novel  and the film and TV adaptations  inspired millions to take up the sport Everybody wanted to go surfing  She no longer surfs  but paddles while watching others Sometimes it gets little crowded and people have to watch out she said  Zuckerman did not approve of localism I think we have to respect everyone that gets into the water

 hours in Melbourne  what to do  where to go,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/18/48-hours-in-melbourne-what-to-do-where-to-go,travel,A weekend in Melbourne  It never long enough  As with any hometown  it a place filled with old friends and heavy with memories and associations  live in Sydney now but each time return to Melbourne not only get nostalgic for the past  but excited for what the city continues to become Melbourne reminds me of glorious old house with rooms inside rooms inside rooms  Each new visit  new door is opened and behind it might be daring restaurant  park hadn visited  bar down laneway d walked past million times but had never noticed Melbourne reminds me of glorious old house with rooms inside rooms inside roomsA city is only as exciting and creative as its citizens and that bodes well for Melbourne  No one city in Australia has monopoly on good conversation  but in Melbourne it has tendency to flow  It could be something to do with where we meet  Melbourne best bits are tucked away  It a city of interiors cafes  restaurants  bars  galleries  bookshops places that are good for talking My Melbourne is mostly northside  city of the back streets of Fitzroy  late nights on Smith Street  walks or bike rides in Clifton Hill  Sunday markets at the Abbotsford convent  the movies and dinner in Carlton  the bars of Gertrude Street But speak to someone who lives to the south  in Elwood or St Kilda or Prahran  and their Melbourne will be of bays and beaches  the nightclubs of Chapel Street  the avenues of Albert Park  the antique stores of Armadale and the boutiques of Brighton The one thing that unites north and south is love of AFL so if you are in Melbourne over winter weekend  make sure you catch game at the   I back regularly but these days need to confine my visits to  hour period  So ll come in on Friday afternoon on Tiger flight and then get the Skybus   to the old Spencer Street station  now known as Southern Cross station That road in from the airport  flat and long  industrial  usually under low grey skies  unimproved by the splashes of colour and distraction of the Jeff Kennett era bridges  never hints at Melbourne rich hinterland  This is place where you have to know where to go  because unlike Sydney the good stuff doesn just jump out at you  pm  coffee and book shopsAfter getting the Skybus from the airport and buying Myki transport card  from    or newsagents head into the CBD and grab coffee  Melbourne caffeine scene is justifiably world famous  and even the most modest looking sandwich bar will serve you decent coffee I take tram up from Southern Cross station to the Paris end of town at the corner of Bourke and Spring  recommend visit to the nearby Pellegrini at the top of Bourke Street one of the first cafes to open in Melbourne  in    The coffee here is bit bitter but for slice of Melbourne history it worth dropping into the family run business and downing cup from your seat at the counter  Pellegrini also serves up hearty Italian fare for around   for plate of pasta In the vicinity is City Wine Shop  It a lovely bar at night  surrounded by wall of bottles and low lighting and frequented by journos and political types from Spring Street  hence the need for dim lighting  but during the day they do reliably smooth  almost creamy flat white  There also selection of top shelf wines to take away After you ve had your caffeine fix  visit two of Melbourne best bookstores just round the corner in Bourke Street  Hill of Content  stately institution on the corner of Bourke and Exhibition  has very knowledgeable staff  while the more raffish Paperback  again on Bourke Street  is also worth exploring  particularly its bargain table  It impossible to leave either store without purchasing something  pm  check in  Sheraton HotelI stay at the new Sheraton at the Spring Street end of Little Collins Street  which is tall  elegant hotel with rooftop bar and spacious rooms with very comfortable beds There been dearth of new hotels in the city for number of years but now they are springing up all over the place  As well as the Crown Metropol  there the Langham  rash of art hotels  the Cullen  the Olsen and the Blackman the new Hilton Double Tree down by Flinders Street station and  opening late last year  the Sheraton at the top of Little Collins Street There been dearth of new hotels in the city for number of years but now they are springing up all over the place If you prefer something little more homey  can recommend the Brooklyn Arts Hotel in converted Fitzroy terrace just off the uber cool Gertrude Street  pm  pre dinner drinksNot far from the Sheraton  in the Meyers Place laneway  there are enough little bars for mini crawl before dinner The sort of unnamed  ie there no sign  Meyers Place Bar is one of the original Melbourne laneway bars from the   and still one of the best  It simple and unpretentious  with recycled timber furniture  good music and not too pricey drinks Nearby  if you feel like something fancier  cocktail perhaps in luxe art deco surroundings  head next door to Lily Blacks  pm  dinner  Flinders LaneA few years ago  Melbourne was hit by new phenomenon  queues of people standing outside restaurants  sometimes for an hour or more  waiting for table  The wave of super hot  no booking restaurants included Chin Chin  Asian fusion  and Mamasita  Mexican  It to Chin Chin  head  sans booking  for dinner  The wait is mere  minutes this time and am offered seat at the bar in the meantime Dishes on offer  bring heap of people with you and order everything to share  include crispy barramundi and green apple salad  salt and pepper soft shell crusted crab and the twice cooked beef short rib  If you can decide  for   person staff will give you selection of their favourite dishes Other great restaurants in Flinders Lane  an absolute dining hot spot  include Coda  Supernormal and Cumulus Inc   pm  after dinner and up late  Cherry BarThere a load of bars in the city  and half the fun is wandering around and finding them yourself  look out for things like dim light above the door  or queue of people down laneway lining up behind bin  but why not walk up few blocks to ACDC Lane and see some live music  Cherry Bar is an institution unpretentious  gritty and dedicated to live music  It became famous for turning away Lady Gaga because it had previous booking with local band and it is this loyalty to the Melbourne music scene  and dedication to providing space for emerging bands  that has earned it so many die hard fans It also lot of fun  particularly late at night  The carpet is sticky  the characters by the bar in the cowboy hats can be kooky  the music is loud  but this is the real deal and there are gigs on every night   am  brunch  Gertrude StreetThe Sheraton does great breakfast but if you feel like exploring outside your hotel  head towards Fitzroy where Brunswick and Gertrude streets have lots of great brunch options Fitzroy Brunswick and Gertrude streets have lots of great brunch options You don have to be vegan to enjoy Smith and Daughters just be prepared to enjoy your latte with soy  The eggs with Mexican twist are excellent For those lusting after bacon  De Clieu on Gertrude Street around the corner does great Berkshire pork neck breakfast   am  city walkHead back towards the city for spot of shopping  Melbourne has always had the edge over other Australian cities when it comes to shopping you just have to walk through the Block and Royal arcades to see the exquisite detail in the mosaic tiles and ceiling details  The evergreen Hopetoun Tea Rooms in the Block Arcade is great example of where Melbournites of yore  and still today  would take break from their shopping at David Jones or Myer and enjoy lavish cake or solid scone with strong cup of tea For newer and flashier shopping try the refurbished GPO on the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth streets or Emporium at Melbourne Central  which opened last year and features local designers such as Scanlan and Theodore  Gorman  Godwin Charli  Arthur Galan  Shoes  Mr Simple and Autonomy alongside international brands including Uniqlo  pm  AFL match at the MCGHead over to the Melbourne Cricket Ground for an afternoon game  Any game  Nothing beats an afternoon walking to the MCG through leafy East Melbourne with thousands of others Even before they are named  Melbourne babies are swaddled in team colours  It more than sport  it a tribe you belong to for life So pick team  go to game and barrack with the best of them  pm  rooftop barsAfter the footy  right on dusk  it time to explore some of Melbourne famous rooftop bars  The city has some of the best this side of Manhattan  there even new  camping  hotel on one rooftop  at Melbourne Central  My favourite rooftops for drink include Rooftop Bar  at Curtin House  which also houses the excellent Cookie and Toff Siglo  the goddess of rooftop bars in the same building as the Supper Club and overlooking Parliament House  Goldilocks  the quirky Madame Brussels and Fitzroy Naked in the Sky  pm  dinnerIf you re on budget  head to Chinatown for cheap dumplings at the legendary Shanghai Dumpling House  followed by beer at Section  shipping containers in vacant lot  or  for more upmarket but still affordable dumpling experience  head to the three storey Hutong Dumpling Bar off Bourke Street If you have bit more cash to splash  suggest dinner at the fabulous Asian inspired Supernormal  in Flinders Lane  followed by an after dinner drink at Cumulus Up  am  hot air ballooningIt an early start  an hour before sunrise but Melbourne and Canberra are the only two of Australia capitals to allow hot air ballooning over the CBD  so it worth adding to your itinerary if your budget allows it up to  per person When lived in Melbourne  would emerge bleary eyed for an early shift and see flotilla of hot air balloons drift across the dawn sky Now m in one with around  others and it exhilarating  To look down over the MCG  to float above the office blocks and church spires  to see across to the beaches of Frankston and bays of St Kilda  where even the brown of the Yarra is sparkling in the kind morning light  is to see the city with new eyes And then there the peace of it  It so gentle and in the basket there a sense of stability  After an hour in the air  we land near the zoo with small thud and tinge of regret at being back on the ground Head back to your hotel for breakfast  or do as did and join your fellow balloon travellers for breakfast and debrief in the dining room at the Pullman in East Melbourne   am  Royal Botanical Gardens  East MelbourneNumber plates in Victoria used to proclaim it as the  garden state Two of my favourite gardens are the Treasury Gardens on the city fringe and the adjoining Royal Botanical Gardens in East Melbourne They are lovely places to explore  run around  you often hear Melbourne people talk about running the  Tan or just take newspaper or book  find bench and relax in the quiet  green spaces    am  lunch  Le Jardin TanIt appropriate your  hours in Melbourne should end with yet more food Shannon Bennett latest eatery  located at the Observatory Cafe at the Botanical Gardens  is cafe and bar that reinterprets Vietnamese food as it was under the country French colonial rulers  All produce is sourced locally  as is Shannon Bennett way  from property at Burnham Beeches

says Jill Anderson  an allotment owner in Surrey Once you get it going  it saves money and you can easily grow basics like carrots and radishes  as well as new potatoes and gooseberries  which can be expensive to buy  Even if you don have enough outdoor space to swing spade you still have options  Keep an eye on your local Freecyle and Freegle groups as garden shares are sometimes advertised you work in them in return for free veg There are also community gardens where you can give your time in return for heavily discounted or free surplus produce  More permanent arrangements include land sharing schemes such as Landshare from River Cottage  to bring growers and landowners together  And you can learn about growing for free when you volunteer with an organisation  such as World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms Worldwide  almost   of fruit and vegetables will go to waste before they even reach consumers  according to figures from the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation  FAO and the Soil Association calculates that in the UK   of produce is rejected because it misshapen  However  there is campaign for buying  ugly veg  and supermarkets are making this easier Asda Wonky

for  kg  in the Wonky range they are p for  kg  per  kg  Later this month  Waitrose will begin selling  bags of weather blemished apples  and its Waitrose limited selection tomatoes are already on the shelves priced at   for  kg  This compares to   per  kg for similar tomato varieties in the store standard range Sainsbury sells less than perfectly shaped fruit and vegetables in its Basics range for example  four avocados for    while  of Basics Sainsbury crunchy salad is p At markets  boxes of bashed or ugly fruit can go for few pence or even free at the end of the day  You can also buy heavily discounted veggies which need to be used that day  at markets  supermarkets and on the high street  Some independents even give away over ripe produce  At Manchester Unicorn Grocery  for example  there is often box of free ready to eat fruit and vegetables The Food Assembly  which actually started in France  scooped the Best British food initiative at this year BBC Food and Farming awards Launched in the UK last July  it is like mix between farmers  market and food buying group  and already has    members across the country Customers can buy boxes of different produce or individual

rhubarb for   for   and organic onions are  kilo Each assembly is run by leader who organises venues and signs up local producers and growers to the scheme  Products are advertised on central website and local page  and consumers pay for the produce online and collect their goods at weekly event  which producers also attend  You might imagine that local produce means hefty price tag  but the pricing is very reasonable for the quality of produce you are getting  and collecting everything on specific day is very convenient says Holly Nelson  member of the Chester Food Assembly The Food Assembly takes   of the pre tax turnover from each producer and gives   of this to the assembly leader  Being leader isn a get rich quick scheme  but the extra income  events can be held outside

Home brewed heroin  Scientists create yeast that can make sugar into opiates,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/18/home-brewed-heroin-scientists-yeast-that-can-make-sugar-into-opiates,science,Home brewed heroin could become reality  scientists have warned  following the creation of yeast strains designed to convert sugar into opiates The advance marks the first time that scientists have artificially reproduced the entire chemical pathway that takes place in poppy plants to produce morphine in the wild Scientists warned that the findings could pave the way for opium poppy farms being replaced by local morphine  breweries  and called for urgent regulation of the technology  In theory  opium brewing would be no more difficult to master than DIY beer kits  raising the possibility of people setting up Breaking Bad style drug laboratories in their own homes Tania Bubela  public health professor at the university of Alberta and co author of commentary on the research in the journal Nature  said In principle  anyone with access to the yeast strain and basic skills in fermentation could grow morphine producing yeast using home brew kit for beer making  The team behind the advance have stopped one step short of linking together the entire chemical chain within single easy to brew yeast strain  and announced self imposed moratorium on the work to allow law enforcement agencies and regulators time to catch up  We re certainly not aiming for the illicit drugs market  that for sure said Vincent Martin  microbiologist at Concordia University in Que bec and co author We realised that we re entering into brave new territory here  Me and my collaborators felt that various regulatory bodies should be consulted and talked to and we should build consensus of how to take this forward  The findings  published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology  mark turning point in efforts that have been made for more than decade to replicate in microbes the  step chemical pathway in the poppy plant Scientists had previously succeeded in reproducing the second half of the chemical pathway  but the initial conversion of glucose to compound called reticuline had proved sticking point  The latest study cracks this problem for the first time by inserting genes from the poppy plant  sugar beet and soil dwelling bacteria into yeast Several existing yeast strains are available that can turn reticuline into morphine  and the scientists said that combining the two halves of the process was now feasible although they have not yet attempted this final step  What you really want to do from fermentation perspective is to be able to feed the yeast glucose  which is cheap sugar source  and have the yeast do all the chemical steps required downstream to make your target therapeutic drug said John Dueber  lead author and bioengineer at the University of California  Berkeley With our study  all the steps have been described  and it now matter of linking them together and scaling up the process  It not trivial challenge  but it doable  He predicted timeline of  couple of years  not decade  for the reliable production of controlled drugs by sugar fed yeast Being able to synthesise opiates in the laboratory raises the possibility of engineering new therapeutic forms of the drug  designed to be less addictive  more powerful or longer lasting  for instance  It creates platform for finding new chemical structures that could have lot of potential benefits said Martin However  it also raises concerns about the yeast falling into the wrong hands  In their commentary  Bubela and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  call for urgent regulation of the technology warning that it could lead to an alternative system for current criminal networks  particularly in North America and Europe  where the drugs are in high demand Because yeast is so easy to conceal  grow and transport  criminal syndicates and law enforcement agencies would have difficulty controlling the distribution of an opiate producing yeast strain the authors write All told  decentralised and localised production would almost certainly reduce the cost and increase the availability of illegal opiates substantially worsening worldwide problem  Future strains of morphine producing yeast could be designed to have unusual nutrient requirements as biocontainment measure  Bubela suggests  Such strains should also be kept in bio secure facilities in the future  with similar safeguards to those used by researchers working with anthrax or smallpox Globally  more than  million people use opiates illegally  The drugs come from the misuse of prescription pain medications and from illegally cultivated poppy crops in countries such as Afghanistan  Laos and Mexico  The time is now to think about policies to address this area of research said Dueber The field is moving surprisingly fast  and we need to be out in front so that we can mitigate the potential for abuse  Martin said the team had no plans to complete the chain until regulations were in place to do so safely If this is something that we shouldn do  let talk about it now he added 
Letters TO Prince Charles  FROM scientists,https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/may/18/letters-prince-charles-scientists-satire,science,Prince Charles letters to various government officials have finally been published  following  year legal battle by the Guardian  They reveal figure who is rather mild in his tone and delivery  but is making his views and desires clear  You could be forgiven for thinking they re basically very aristocratic equivalent of the sort of letters you read in local newspapers  where some retiree will dedicate many paragraphs to bemoaning the declining state of the flower beds in the local park ever since they allowed homosexuals to marry  or some such thing Such behaviour is almost entirely harmless  But when it the heir to the throne doing it and he has access to the people supposedly running the country  then it can very easily become harmful But who to say the published letters are the extent of it  Prince Charles has very diverse range of interests  and one of these is science  Or  more accurately  his dislike of it  And when Prince Charles doesn like something  he clearly resorts to writing letters about it  What if Prince Charles has also written to scientists to express his wishes too  It ll probably be another  year legal battle to find out what he said  if anything  but you can imagine how scientists  not necessarily beholden to Royal etiquette  may have responded Your Royal HighnessThank you for your recent letter  It is always an honour to receive communication from such an illustrious and influential figure  and hope you will continue to think of our institution and laboratories should you require any advice or information from the field of physics in the future However  much as it pains me to say so  with regards to the enquiries and intentions explained in your previous letter  m afraid cannot help you  and it is almost certain that nobody else will be able to either Your passion for architecture is renowned and would certainly never intentionally wish to disappoint such prestigious figure as yourself  but your current ambitions are beyond the means of modern science to achieve  While don doubt that the field of architecture would indeed be greatly enhanced and may well experience some form of renaissance should the strength of gravity be lowered for new building projects  it is not we physicists that determine the gravity we experience  it is actually consequence of the mass of planet Earth It would no doubt be great boon for everyone should the  as you put it outmoded limitations  of gravity be adjusted  but at present this is not achievable  You refer to us having uncovered the source of mass in the Higgs Boson  but us having identified something does not  in fact  give us any authority over it I regret having to be the one to inform you that this is the case Your humble servant REDACTED Your Royal Highness I thank you sincerely for your recent letter  and am greatly encouraged by your admittedly surprising but very welcome sudden interest in our very important but typically overlooked field However  it is with deepest regret that cannot provide you with more conclusive answer to your query  because there is insufficient usable data available  Despite the long history of our great kingdom  there still have been relatively few ruling monarchs in statistical terms  There may have still been enough to make some reasonable predictions  but we also need to take into account the fact that our culture and society has changed considerably since the monarchy was established  and as result ruling monarchs have met their end in wide variety of ways  which causes lot of disruption for mathematical models To conclude  m afraid it is currently not feasible to accurately predict when ruling monarch will die  admit to being unsure as to why you wish to know such information  but it is not my place to enquire I sorry couldn be more helpful Yours sincerely REDACTED Dear Your Royal Highness HRH the Prince of WalesI thank you for your recent letter  and applaud your efforts to become more engaged and involved with the health of your future kingdom  particularly with the growing problem of obesity Despite your enthusiasm  m afraid cannot fulfil your request  While respected in my field  would certainly not go so far as to say have any influence or authority when it comes to the dietary policy of the government or the NHS  However  even if were in such position  could not in good conscience implement policy whereby all people in the UK are advised to exclusively eat Duchy Originals products While no doubt quality organic produce  the brand does not create enough foodstuffs at an affordable enough price to feed the growing UK population in perpetuity Also  oat biscuits are not part of the recommended a day  Quite the opposite I sorry can be more helpful  but wish you well in your endeavoursYour humble servant REDACTED To HRH  the Prince of WalesThank you for your recent letter to our department  It is indeed an unexpected honour to receive communication from such an esteemed individual in such position as yours  For this alone  we are grateful  especially when you consider that the majority of messages we receive from high profile and influential types are usually more negative However  and others in our department regret to report that we have all found ourselves largely perplexed by the questions you put forward in your letter  We are all great admirers of your public stance on climate change so we would be more than keen to aid you in your enquiries  but m afraid none of us here are able to do so  It is true that climate change will likely result in sea level rises  but whether or not this will provide homeopathic benefits is not something we re able to speculate on in our division Some basic research reveals that homeopathy argues that dilution can bring about therapeutic benefits  but even if this were feasible  and it doesn seem to be exactly how this applies to climate change effects is even less clear  Diluting the sea to address concerns of sea level rises would be very self limiting approach  to say the least You may have more luck contacting our colleagues in the medical departments  perhaps Yours faithfully Redacted Dear CharlesStop writing to us I have had some stern words with our colleagues in the climate science department about this  and they regret they ever told you to contact us  As we told you in our first response  quite politely  thought we do not now or will we ever endorse homeopathic remedies as viable first line treatment for all illnesses I sorry this is not acceptable to you  but as offensive as it may seem m afraid the laws of physics and biology don recognise the authority of heredity monarchy so are indifferent to your wishes  We in medicine have to adhere to the functions of the human body as they are  not how we like them to be Also  while m sure it was  organic  leaving flaming bag of excrement on our doorstep doesn seem like the sort of conduct you expect from king in waiting Just saying REDACTED Dean Burnett once wrote to Prince Charles to invite him to student play he was arranging  but he never came and he been angry ever since  so he made all this up  He on Twitter garwboy
A new milestone in non pharmaceutical treatments for depression,https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/may/18/non-pharmaceutical-treatments-for-depression-magstim-tms,science,Mood disorders such as depression are devastating to sufferers  and hugely costly to treat  The most severe form of depression  often called clinical depression or major depressive disorder  MDD increases the person likelihood of suicide and contributes significantly to person disability adjusted life years  DALYs a measure of quality of life taking into account periods of incapacity  The healthcare burden of MDD is large in most countries  especially when the person requires stay in hospital  Putting these factors together  it clear we need to develop effective treatments to combat depression The mechanisms of depressive disorders are not well understood  and it seems likely that there is no single cause  Most modern therapies use drugs that target neurotransmitters the chemicals that carry signals between neurons  For example  the class of drugs known as SSRIs  or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  prevent the neurotransmitter serotonin from being reabsorbed by neuron  this means that more serotonin is available to wash around between the nerve cells  and is more likely to activate cells in the brain networks that area affected in MDD But SSRIs and other drugs are not pharmacological  free lunch Drug treatments for depression are ineffective for many people  cause side effects  and may lose their therapeutic effect over time  For these reasons  many researchers are searching for alternative treatments for MDD that overcome these problems  and are more effective or less unpleasant  One potential treatment involves the use of pulses of magnetic energy over the head to target the brain mood circuits  This technique  called transcranial magnetic stimulation  TMS may potentially address some of the problems of pharmaceutical treatments  but we still don know exactly how it works  or how effective it will be in treating MDD Some of these mysteries may be close to solution however  with last week news that company based in West Wales was granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration to enter the USA market for device based treatment of MDD  The approval of the Magstim Company Rapid  stimulator means that the stimulator can be used as treatment option in adult sufferers of MDD who have not responded to other therapy  or drug based treatments  Magstim products have long been used in universities and research centres to probe and modulate brain function  and approval of these devices for clinical use marks an important milestone in translational neuroscience the idea of taking academic findings into the clinic TMS works by sending pulses of magnetic energy across the skull  These magnetic fields induce electric currents to flow in small patches of the brain of around one square centimetre  which in turn causes the neurons in that area to activate these events take place over fractions of second  For reasons that are not well understood  spacing out trains of these magnetic pulses leads to more durable effects  lasting for an hour or more after the stimulation this is known as repetitive TMS  or rTMS  Repeated sessions of rTMS  given every day for several days  exploit the brain plasticity to change brain activity for many months  This gives neuroscientists way to reorganise  never  rewire small brain circuits rTMS treatment for MDD targets the prefrontal cortex  usually in spot few centimetres above the corner of the left eye  called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  or DLPFC The cells in this area connect to networks that project throughout the brain  and rTMS has both enhancing and inhibiting effects on distant brain regions  The full extent of these hubs and networks are poorly understood  but it seems clear that modulating the activity of the prefrontal cortex releases neurotransmitters deep in the ancient structures of the midbrain  in particular the caudate nucleus  In turn  these structures regulate our basic motivations and emotions  So by indirectly stimulating these regions  rTMS seems to correct the low mood and listlessness of MDD in some people Is rTMS the future of depression treatment  The treatment certainly looks promising  with increased remittance rates and seemingly few side effects  Baseline depression scores may be reduced by up to third according to some studies  although other studies are more cautious  It seems that longer courses of treatment  lasting several weeks  have greater effects this suggests an additive effect of rTMS on the brain over time  However the uncertainties over the mechanisms of rTMS in MDD mean that neurologists will find it difficult to personalise treatment for an individual patient  The number of parameters involved in rTMS  such as the number of pulses to deliver  or the intensity of each pulse  make it difficult to specify precisely the dose required for patient  Precision is also problem in locating the exact target in prefrontal cortex for stimulation each person brain folds in its own way  and missing the DLPFC even by centimetre can mean the difference between person being  responder  or  non responder in the stark language of psychiatry  Moreover  the physical sensation of rTMS  which can feel like woodpecker tapping the head  makes it difficult to create placebo condition for use in clinical trials rTMS is currently approved for use only in the USA  and only in restricted group of patients  However it is likely that  with further research into improvements in efficacy and in understanding the mechanisms of the technique  we will see increasing use of rTMS as treatment for this burdensome disorder  The entry of Magstim into this market offers clinicians new avenue for people who may be running out of drug based options  and marks an important milestone in taking knowledge gained in research and making use of it for the benefit of many Dr Nick Davis is lecturer in psychology at Swansea University  You can find him on Twitter here
